<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>These are eventful times. With history-making changes
passing rapidly before men's eyes, the questions press upon
thoughtful minds in all lands, What do these things mean?
What next in the program of world-shaping events?</p>

<p>Like a great searchlight shining across the centuries, the
sure Word of Prophecy focuses its bright beams upon Our
Day. In this light we see clearly the trend of events, and
may understand what comes next in the program of history
fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p>In the Volume of the Book the living God speaks to Our
Day of events of the past that have a lesson for the present,
and of things to come. Divine prophecy fulfilled before
men's eyes is God's challenge to unbelief. The Word of Holy
Writ has been the guiding light through all the ages. It is
the lamp to our feet today.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BOOK_THAT_SPEAKS_TO_OUR_DAY" id="THE_BOOK_THAT_SPEAKS_TO_OUR_DAY"></a>THE BOOK THAT SPEAKS TO OUR DAY</h2>


<p>Man may write a true book, but only God, the source of
life, can write a living book. "The word of God ... liveth
and abideth forever." 1 Peter 1:23. The Bible is the living
word of God. We look at the volume; we hold it in our hands.
It is like other books in form and printer's art. But the
voice of God speaks from these pages, and the word spoken
is alive. It is able to do in the heart that receives it what
can be done only by divine power.</p>


<h4>The Book That Talks</h4>

<p>Far in the heart of Africa a missionary read to the people
in their own language from the translated Word of God.
"See!" they cried; "see! the book talks! The white man
has a book that talks!" With that simplicity of speech so
common to children of nature, they had exactly described it.
This is a book that talks. What the wise man says of its
counsels through parents to children, is true of all the book:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
"When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest,
it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with
thee." Prov. 6:22.</p>

<p>Here is companionship, faithful and true, a blessed guide
and guardian and friend.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Holy Bible! book divine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Precious treasure, thou art mine!"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>God Its Author</h4>

<p>The sixty-six books of Holy Scripture were written by
many penmen, over a space of fifteen centuries; yet it is one
book, and one voice speaks through all its pages. Spurgeon
once said of his experience with this book:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When I see it, I seem to hear a voice springing up from it, saying,
'I am the book of God; man, read me. I am God's writing; open my
leaf, for I was penned by God; read it, for He is my author.'"</p></div>

<p>This book declares of itself: "All scripture is given by
inspiration of God." 2 Tim. 3:16. "The prophecy came
not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God
spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost." 2 Peter
1:21. As the rugged verse of the old hymn puts it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let all the heathen writers join<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To form one perfect book:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great God, if once compared with Thine,<br /></span>

<p>It is the voice of the Almighty. Very different it is from
the sacred books of the non-Christian religions. In those
writings it is man speaking about God; in the Holy Scriptures
it is God speaking to man. The difference is as great
as heaven is higher than earth. Here it is not man groping
in the darkness after God. In this book of God's revelation
we see the divine arm reaching down to save the lost,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and hear the voice of the loving Father calling to His children,
every one and everywhere. "Incline your ear," He
calls; "hear, and your soul shall live." Isa. 55:3.</p>


<h4>The Word That Creates</h4>

<p>We must have something more than instruction; we must
have a word of power that is able to tell of sins forgiven,
and to conduct us beyond the grave to heaven. One of the
greatest of China's sages, Mencius, said, "Instruction can impart
information, but not the power to execute." That
touches the crucial point. We must have instruction that
can come with power divine to execute. We have it only
in God's words. Christ said: "It is the spirit that quickeneth;
the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak
unto you, they are spirit, and they are life." John 6:63.</p>

<p>The words of God are living words. When God spoke
in the beginning, "Let there be light," lo, the light sprang
out of the darkness. There was power in the word spoken
to bring forth. "Let the earth bring forth grass," was the
word of the Lord: and the earth was carpeted with its first
rich greensward. So through all the work of creation, the
creative power was in the word spoken.</p>

<p>"By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all
the host of them by the breath of His mouth." "He spake,
and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast." Ps.
33:6, 9.</p>

<p>Even so, when this word speaks instruction to man, there
is creative power in the word, if received, to work mightily
in the soul that is dead in trespasses and sins. Man must
be born again, be re-created. That we know; for Christ
says, "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born
again ["from above," margin], he cannot see the kingdom
of God." John 3:3.</p>

<p>And the word of God&mdash;the Bible from heaven&mdash;received
by faith, is the agency by which this new birth "from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
above" is wrought. This is the declaration of our text:
"Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,
by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever."
1 Peter 1:23.</p>

<h4><b>The Word That Works Within</b></h4>

<p>Not only does the word of God give the new birth, making
the believer a new man,&mdash;the past forgiven and a new heart
within,&mdash;but the word that re-creates abides in the believing
heart that studies it and clings to it, to work in the life with
actual power that is not of the man himself. To the Thessalonians,
who had "turned to God from idols to serve the
living and true God," the apostle wrote:</p>

<p>"For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because,
when ye received the word of God which ye heard of
us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth,
the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that
believe." 1 Thess. 2:13.</p>

<p>The word itself works within, and works effectually.
There is nothing mechanical about it. The mere letter profits
nothing. The Bible on the center table, unstudied and
unloved, has no magic power. But God promises to abide
by His Spirit of power in the heart that listens to His voice
and trembles at His word. Jesus Himself tells us the secret
of this power of the word to work in the believing heart:</p>

<p>"If a man love Me, he will keep My words: and My Father
will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our
abode with him." John 14:23.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that believing and receiving the word
brings divine power into the life, making it possible for transformations
of character to be wrought, for victories to be
won and obedience rendered to every command of God.</p>

<p>Simply believing God's word touches the current of everlasting
power, even as the trolley arm of the electric car
reaches up and touches the current of power flowing through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the wire overhead. The faith that takes the living word
brings the power divine into the heart to move all the spiritual
mechanism of life's service.</p>


<h4><b>The Word Our Safety and Defense</b></h4>

<p>When Christ came to live as our example in the flesh,
and to give His life a sacrifice for sin, He, the divine Son of
God, made Himself like unto His brethren. "I can of Mine
own self do nothing," He said. John 5:30. Tempted and
tried, He found His defense in the Holy Scriptures. When
Satan came to tempt Him to sin, the Saviour said, "It is
written." He clung to the sure defense. Again the tempter
came. He was met with the word, "It is written again."
The third time it was the same weapon of defense, "It is
written." Matt. 4:1-11.</p>

<p>Christ found safety only in the Scriptures of truth. So
the Bible is the Christian's shield against the enemy's attacks.
As Jesus studied the Scriptures and kept the words
ever in His heart for a defense against temptation, so must
every Christian study and meditate upon God's Holy Word
if its counsels and precepts are to be his defense in the moment
of sudden temptation to sin. "Thy word have I hid in
mine heart," said the psalmist, "that I might not sin against
Thee." Ps. 119:11. It was the only way for Christ, our
Pattern; it is the only way for us.</p>


<h4><b>The Bread of Life</b></h4>

<p>The word of God is the daily food for the soul. "It is
written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word
that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." Matt. 4:4.</p>

<p>Who has not, in hurried times, missed a meal, working
on through the day, never thinking of the prolonged fast?
But after a time there came a sense of weakening force, a
lack of physical power. What was the trouble? At once
the reason was evident&mdash;one had not taken food, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
system was calling for a renewal of its forces. Just so the
spiritual life must needs be fed by the word of God.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 298px;">
<img src="images/p019.jpg" width="298" height="448" alt="CHRIST&#39;S WEAPON OF DEFENSE&mdash;THE
WORD OF GOD

&quot;Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written,
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy
God, and Him only shalt thou serve.&quot;

<span class="caption">CHRIST&#39;S WEAPON OF DEFENSE&mdash;THE

Matt. 4:10.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Do we at times feel a sense of weakening of the spiritual
power, a letting down of the vital forces of the soul? Ah,
in the hurry of life we have neglected to feed upon the living
bread. We can no more sustain spiritual vigor and health
without feeding daily upon God's Holy Word than we can
maintain physical power without eating our daily bread.
Eat of the life-giving word. The taste for it grows with the
partaking.</p>

<p>There is life in "every word." The psalmist found the
Lord's testimonies "sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb,"
or, as the marginal reading has it, than "the dropping
of honeycombs." Ps. 19:10. We get the picture of
the honeycomb inverted, the cell caps broken open, the sweetness
dripping down. Just so every word of the Lord is a
cell full of sweetness and life for the soul that feasts upon
the Holy Scriptures.</p>


<h4><b>The Source of All Doctrine</b></h4>

<p>The Bible is the complete and perfect rule of faith and
doctrine. Here every doctrine of salvation is found. Inspiration
has declared it in the words of the apostle Paul to
Timothy:</p>

<p>"From a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures,
which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through
faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is given by inspiration
of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof,
for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man
of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good
works." 2 Tim. 3:15-17.</p>

<p>The divine command is, "Study." For every generation
there has been a message borne by this living word, making
call to reformation of life, or giving warning and comfort.
"The Bible is not a collection of truths formulated in propositions,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
said Dr. Samuel Harris, of Yale, "but God's
majestic march through history, redeeming men from sin."</p>

<p>In every age God has been ruling and overruling, witnessing
by His Spirit through the living word. The experiences
recorded of past ages have their special lesson for the present
time:</p>

<p>"Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written
for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the
Scriptures might have hope." Rom. 15:4.</p>

<p>"Let vs therfore all with feruent desyre," as the Old
English of 1549 spelled the exhortation of Erasmus, "thyrste
after these spirituall sprynges.... Let vs kisse these swete
wordes of Christ with a pure affeccion. Let vs be newe
transformed into them, for soche are oure maners as oure
studies be."</p>


<h4><b>The Book for All Mankind</b></h4>

<p>It speaks in every tongue to the human heart. Its power
to transform has been shown through all the centuries in
every clime and among every race. One of the Gospels was
put into the Chiluba tongue of Central Africa. After a time
a Garenganze chief came to Dan Crawford, the missionary,
changed from the spirit of a fierce, wicked barbarian to that
of a teachable child. Explaining his conversion, the chief
said: "I was startled to find that Christ could speak Chiluba.
I heard him speak to me out of the printed page, and what
he said was, 'Follow me!'"</p>

<p>Of the Bible's universal speech to all mankind, Dr. Henry
van Dyke has said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Born in the East, and clothed in Oriental form and imagery, the
Bible walks the ways of all the world with familiar feet, and enters land
after land to find its own everywhere. It has learned to speak in hundreds
of languages to the heart of man. It comes into the palace to tell
the monarch that he is the servant of the Most High, and into the cottage
to assure the peasant that he is the son of God. Children listen to
its stories with wonder and delight, and wise men ponder them as parables<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of life. It has a word of peace for the time of peril, a word of comfort
for the day of calamity, a word of light for the hour of darkness.
Its oracles are repeated in the assembly of the people, and its counsels
whispered in the ear of the lonely. The wise and the proud tremble
at its warnings, but to the wounded and penitent it has a mother's
voice....</p>

<p>"Its great words grow richer, as pearls do when they are worn near
the heart. No man is poor or desolate who has this treasure for his own.
When the landscape darkens and the trembling pilgrim comes to the
valley named the Shadow, he is not afraid to enter; he takes the rod and
staff of Scripture in his hand; he says to friend and comrade, 'Good-by,
we shall meet again,' and comforted by that support, he goes toward the
lonely pass as one who climbs through darkness into light."&mdash;<i>The Century
Magazine.</i></p></div>

</div>

<p>In the days of His life on earth, Jesus was a welcome
guest in humble homes in Judea and Galilee. "The common
people heard Him gladly." His presence brought peace and
comfort to the home. He is no longer with us in bodily presence;
but He is the same Saviour still&mdash;"Jesus Christ the
same yesterday, and today, and forever." Heb. 13:8. By<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
His Spirit, through the living word of Holy Scripture, He
enters the home where faith receives Him, and speaks again
the gracious salutation, "Peace be to this house."</p>


<h4><b>Christ the Central Theme</b></h4>

<p>All the Bible bears witness of Christ as the Saviour of
the world. He Himself said of the Scriptures, "They are
they which testify of Me." John 5:39. "To Him give all
the prophets witness." Acts 10:43. We see Him as the
coming Messiah in promise and prophecy, in type and shadow.
His is the divine, living personality standing out in every
book that makes up the Sacred Volume. As we read with
loving heart, the Author seems near in every page.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Reading, methinks I bend<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The whole world's loss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For love of Him is gain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And having beheld Him giving His life as the divine sacrifice,
and rising in triumph over death to be our great High
Priest in the heavenly temple, as we read these Sacred Scriptures
yet again, in every book, from Genesis to Revelation,
we see Him as the coming King of kings, coming to take His
children to the eternal home of the saved. The whole book
is a bright window through which we gaze on coming glory.</p>

<h2>THE WITNESS OF THE CENTURIES</h2>

<h4><b>The Sure Word of Prophecy</b></h4>


<p>"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto
ye do well that ye take heed." 2 Peter 1:19.</p>

<p>The prophetic scriptures afford infallible evidence that
the voice of the living God speaks in Holy Writ. One of
the distinguishing marks of divinity is the power that foretells
and records the course of history long ages before the
events come to pass.</p>


<h4><b>God's Challenge</b></h4>

<p>God's challenge to false religious systems in olden time
was this:</p>

<p>"Declare us things for to come. Show the things that
are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods."
Isa. 41:22, 23.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>And all the gods of the nations were silent; for they are
no gods. The Lord alone, the one who speaks by the Holy
Scriptures, is able to tell the end from the beginning.</p>

<p>"I am God, and there is none like Me, declaring the end
from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are
not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand." Isa. 46:9, 10.</p>

<p>By this means God has borne witness of Himself through
the ages, that it might be known that the Most High rules
above all the kingdoms of men, and that men might recognize
His purpose to put an end to sin and bring eternal salvation
to His people. "I have spoken it," He declares, "I
will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it."</p>

<p>The fulfilment of the word of prophecy in history is a
fascinating story. To the Lord, the future is an open book,
even as the present. The word is spoken, telling of the
event to come; it is written on the parchment scroll by the
prophet's pen. Time passes; centuries come and go. Then,
when the hour of the prophecy arrives, lo, there appears the
fulfilment. And it is seen in matters pertaining to individuals,
as well as in the affairs of cities and empires.</p>


<h4><b>The Word Fulfilled after Long Waiting</b></h4>

<p>In the dream divinely given to the lad Joseph, it was
plainly foretold that his brothers would one day come as suppliants
before him. His father rebuked him for telling the
dream, saying, "Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren
indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?"
Gen. 37:10. The brothers sold the lad into slavery, to be
well rid of him. Yet twenty years later, all unconscious of
his identity, these same brethren presented themselves before
the prime minister of Egypt, and "fell before him on the
ground." Gen. 44:14.</p>

<p>Again: the wicked stronghold of Jericho had been utterly
destroyed. Joshua declared:</p>

<p>"Cursed be the man ... that riseth up and buildeth this
city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his first-born,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it."
Joshua 6:26.</p>

<p>The hands of angels had thrown down its walls, and its
ruin was to stand as a memorial. More than five hundred
years later, when the apostate Ahab was ruling, and Israel
and Judah had departed from the Lord, Hiel the Bethelite
set out to rebuild Jericho. "He laid the foundation thereof
in Abiram his first-born."</p>

<p>But accident and death may come at any time. The
work on the walls went on, no one thinking of the neglected
Scriptures with their warning of long ago. So the full account
runs:</p>

<p>"He laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his first-born,
and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according
to the word of the Lord, which He spake by Joshua
the son of Nun." 1 Kings 16:34.</p>

<p>The fate of some of the mightiest cities the world ever
saw has borne testimony through the centuries to the fulfilment
of the prophetic word.</p>


<h4>The Witness of Nineveh</h4>

<p>Nineveh was founded by Nimrod. He built not only his
capital here by the Tigris, but other towns round about,
conceiving first of all the idea of grouping the capital and its
suburbs into one great city, the "Greater Nineveh," as we
would say in these days of Greater London and Greater New
York. At the dawn of history Nineveh was "a great city."
Gen. 10:11, 12. In Jonah's day it was an "exceeding great
city."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Sennacherib, of the Bible story, was its beautifier.
Rawlinson says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The great palace which he raised at Nineveh surpassed in size and
splendor all earlier edifices."&mdash;<i>"Second Monarchy," chap. 9.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>A description is preserved on the clay cylinder in the
king's own words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For the wonderment of multitudes of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I raised its head&mdash;'the palace which has no rival'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I called its name."&mdash;<i>Taylor Cylinder, "Records of the Past." Vol. XII, part 1</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the preaching of Jonah the city had repented; but in
later years pride of conquest and luxury and wealth were
filling it with blood. The prophet Nahum warned it of certain
doom, appealing to those who had any fear of God to
turn to Him. The message was:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/p028.jpg" width="448" height="280" alt="THE SITE OF NINEVEH

&quot;How is she become a desolation!&quot;
Zeph. 2:15." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE SITE OF NINEVEH<br />

&quot;How is she become a desolation!&quot;
Zeph. 2:15.</span>
</div>

<p>"The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble;
and He knoweth them that trust in Him." Nahum 1:7.</p>

<p>Some, no doubt, heeded the warning and turned to God
for refuge. But the city's life of sin ran on. Then the prophet
Zephaniah spoke the word, just as the stroke was to fall:</p>

<p>"Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing
city! She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
she trusted not in the Lord; she drew not near to her God."
Zeph. 3:1, 2.</p>

<p>Prophecies uttered against the mighty city had declared:</p>

<p>"He will make an utter end of the place thereof." "The
palace shall be dissolved ["molten," margin]." "She is
empty, and void, and waste." Nahum 1:8; 2:6, 10. "How
is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in!"
Zeph. 2:15.</p>

<p>The Medes and the Babylonians overthrew Nineveh. The
king immolated himself in his burning ("molten") palace.
Nineveh became a desolation. Describing a battle that took
place there in the seventh century of our era, between the
Romans and the Persians, the historian Gibbon bears testimony
to the fact that it has indeed become "empty, and
void, and waste:"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Eastward of the Tigris, at the end of the bridge of Mosul, the great
Nineveh had formerly been erected: the city, and even the ruins of the
city, had long since disappeared; the vacant place afforded a spacious
field for the operations of the two armies."&mdash;<i>"The History of the Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire," chap. 46, par. 24.</i></p></div>

<p>And to this day, the site of Nineveh is pointed out across
the river from Mosul, only mounds of ruins, these almost
obliterated by the drifting sands of centuries. The word
spoken is fulfilled, though at the time it was spoken it little
seemed to proud and prosperous Nineveh that such a fate
could ever be hers.</p>

<h4>The Burden of Tyre</h4>

<span class="caption">TYRE BY THE SEA<br />

&quot;They shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and
break down her towers.&quot; Eze. 26:4.</span>
</div>

<p>Tyre was the greatest maritime city of antiquity. Its inhabitants,
the Ph&#339;nicians, traded in the ports of all the known
world. Ezekiel describes the heart of the seas as its borders.
"Thy builders have perfected thy beauty," he says. He
tells how all countries traded in its marts and contributed to
its wealth. And then, obeying the word of the Lord, the
prophet bears a message of rebuke and warning,&mdash;"the burden
of Tyre,"&mdash;and pronounces the coming judgment:</p>

<p>"Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I am against thee,
O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against
thee.... And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her,
and make her like the top of a rock. It shall be a place for
the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have
spoken it, saith the Lord God." Eze. 26:3-5.</p>

<p>The accounts of travelers bear witness that the prophecy
has been fulfilled. As to the site of the island city of
Ezekiel's day, Bruce, nearly a century ago, said that he found
it a "rock whereon fishers dry their nets." (See "Keith on
the Prophecies," p. 329.)</p>

<p>In more recent times, Dr. W.M. Thomson found the
whole region of Tyre suggestive only of departed glory:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is nothing here, certainly, of that which led Joshua to call it
'the strong city' more than three thousand years ago (Joshua 19:29),&mdash;nothing
of that mighty metropolis which baffled the proud Nebuchadnezzar
and all his power for thirteen years, until 'every head' in his army
'was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled,' in the hard service
against Tyrus (Eze. 29:18),&mdash;nothing in this wretched roadstead and
empty harbor to remind one of the times when merry mariners did sing
in her markets&mdash;no visible trace of those towering ramparts which so
long resisted the utmost efforts of the great Alexander. All have vanished
utterly like a troubled dream, and Tyre has sunk under the burden
of prophecy.... As she is now, and has long been, Tyre is God's witness;
but great, powerful, and populous, she would be the infidel's boast. This,
however, she cannot be. Tyre will never rise from her dust to falsify
the voice of prophecy.</p></div>

<h4>The Desolation of Babylon</h4>

<p>Yet another city of ancient times there was, the mightiest
of them all, whose fate was a subject of prophecy, and whose
history bears special testimony for us today; for, more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
any other, the Lord used that city as a symbol of the pride
of life and the exaltation of the selfish heart against God.</p>

<p>Let us study briefly the desolations pronounced upon
Babylon of old.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/p032.jpg" width="448" height="292" alt="BABYLON IN THE DUST

&quot;Babylon shall become heaps,...
without an inhabitant.&quot; Jer. 51:37." title="" />
<span class="caption">BABYLON IN THE DUST<br />

&quot;Babylon shall become heaps,...
without an inhabitant.&quot; Jer. 51:37.</span>
</div>

<p>While Babylon was still the mightiest city of the world,
with the period of greatest glory yet before it, the Lord revealed
its ignoble end. By the prophet Isaiah He declared:</p>

<p>"Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees'
excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and
Gomorrah. It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be
dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the
Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make
their fold there. But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there;
and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls
shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. And the
wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses,
and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to
come, and her days shall not be prolonged." Isa. 13:19-22.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Never could a more doleful future have been pictured
for a city full of splendor, the metropolis of the world. About
one hundred and seventy-five years after this word was written
on the parchment scroll, the Medes and Persians were
at the gates of Babylon. Her time had come, and Chaldea's
rule was ended.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fallen is the golden city! in the dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoiled of her crown, dismantled of her state.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She that hath made the Strength of Towers her trust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weeps by her dead, supremely desolate!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She that beheld the nations at her gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thronging in homage, shall be called no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Lady of Kingdoms!'&mdash;Who shall mourn her fate?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her guilt is full, her march of triumph o'er."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But still, under Medo-Persia, and later under the Greeks,
the city itself was populous and prosperous and beautiful.
The skeptic of the time may have pointed to it as evidence
that here, at least, the Hebrew prophet had missed the mark.</p>

<p>Apollonius, the sage of Tyana, who lived in the days of
Nero and the apostles, has left an account of Babylon as he
saw it, as late as the first century of our era. Still the Euphrates
swept beneath its walls, dividing the city into halves,
with great palaces on either side. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The palaces are roofed with bronze, and a glitter goes off from them;
but the chambers of the women and of the men and the porticoes are
adorned partly with silver, and partly with golden tapestries or curtains,
and partly with solid gold in the form of pictures."</p></div>

<p>And of the king's judgment hall he reported:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The roof had been carried up in the form of a dome, to resemble
in a manner the heavens, and that it was roofed with sapphire, a stone
that is very blue and like heaven to the eye; and there were images of the
gods, which they worship, fixed aloft, and looking like golden figures
shining out of the ether."&mdash;<i>Philostratus, "Life of Apollonius," book 1,
chap. 25.</i></p></div>

<p>Evidently Babylon was still "the land of graven images,"
and the desolation foretold by the prophet had not yet befallen
its palaces. But that prophetic word, written eight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
hundred years before, was still upon the scroll of the Book,
the sure Word of God, who sees the end from the beginning.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/p034.jpg" width="448" height="282" alt="EGYPT&#39;S GLORY DEPARTED

<span class="caption">EGYPT&#39;S GLORY DEPARTED<br />

&quot;The idols of Egypt shall be moved.&quot;
Isa. 19:1.</span>
</div>

<p>The view given us by Apollonius is perhaps the last glimpse
we have of Babylon's passing glory. Even then for centuries
the walls had been a quarry from which stones were
drawn for Babylon's rival, Seleucia, on the Tigris. And
Strabo, the Greek geographer, who also wrote in the first
century, had described Babylon as "in great part deserted,"
adding,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"No one would hesitate to apply to it what one of the comic writers
said of Megalopolit&aelig;, in Arcadia, 'The great city is a great
desert.'"&mdash;<i>"Geography," book 16, chap. 1.</i></p></div>

<p>Already pagan writers had begun to describe its condition
in the terms of the prophecy uttered so long before. And
now what is its state? The doom foretold has fallen heavy
upon the city, upon its palaces, and "upon the graven images
of Babylon." For a century and more, travelers' accounts
have frequently borne witness to the exact fulfilment of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
prophecy in the remarkable desolations of that city, once
mistress of the world.</p>

<p>"Babylon shall become heaps," said the prophecy, "and
owls shall dwell there." This is what Mr. Layard, the English
archeologist, found on his visit in 1845:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Shapeless heaps of rubbish cover for many an acre the face of the
land.... On all sides, fragments of glass, marble, pottery, and inscribed
brick are mingled with that peculiar nitrous and blanched soil, which,
bred from the remains of ancient habitations, checks or destroys vegetation,
and renders the site of Babylon a naked and a hideous waste.
Owls [which are of a large gray kind, and often found in flocks of nearly
a hundred] start from the scanty thickets, and the foul jackal skulks
through the furrows."&mdash;<i>"Discoveries Among the Ruins of Nineveh and
Babylon," chap. 21, p. 413.</i></p></div>

<p>The prophecy said, "Neither shall the Arabian pitch tent
there." The words might be construed to mean that the
famous site would never become the place of a Bedouin village.
But it is literally true, say travelers, that the Arabs
avoid the place even for the temporary pitching of their
tents. They consider the spot under a curse. They call
the ruins <i>Mudjelibe</i>, "the Overturned." (See "Encyclopedia
of Islam," art. "Babil.")</p>

<p>As late as 1913, Missionary W.C. Ising visited the site
where Professor Koldeway was excavating the ruins of Nebuchadnezzar's
palace. He wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Involuntarily one is reminded of the prophecy in the thirteenth of
Isaiah and many other places, which, in course of time, have been fulfilled
to the letter. No one is living on the site of ancient Babylon, and whatever
Arabs are employed by the excavators have built their mud huts
in the bed of the ancient river, which at the present time is shifted half a
mile farther west."&mdash;<i>European Division Quarterly, Fourth Quarter, 1913.</i></p></div>


<h4>Egypt and Edom</h4>

<p>The massive ruins by the Nile bear witness to prophecy
fulfilled. When Egypt rivaled Babylon, the word was spoken:
"It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it
exalt itself any more above the nations." Eze. 29:15. It
was not utterly to pass, as Babylon, but to continue in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
inferior state. Thus it came to pass. Once populous Edom,
famed for wisdom and counsel, now lies desolate, according
to the word: "Edom shall be a desolation: every one that
goeth by it shall be astonished." Jer. 49:17.</p>


<h4>The Testimony of History</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/p036.jpg" width="448" height="293" alt="RUINS OF EDOM

<span class="caption">RUINS OF EDOM<br />

&quot;Edom shall be a desolate wilderness.&quot;
Joel 3:19.</span>
</div>

<p>Thus the centuries bear testimony to the fulfilment of the
prophetic word. The panorama of all human history moves
before us in these writings of the prophets. Flinging their
"colossal shadows" across the pages of Holy Writ, as Farrar
says, we see&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The giant forms of empires on their way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ruin."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is no human book that thus from primitive times forecasts
the march of history through the ages.</p>

<p>The Lord not only spoke the word in warning and entreaty
for those to whom it first came, but it is written in the
Scriptures of truth as a testimony to all time, that the Bible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
is the word of God, and that all His purposes revealed therein
and all the promises of the blessed Book are certain and sure.
The prophets who bore messages from God to Nineveh, and
Babylon, and Tyre, spoke messages also for our day.</p>

<p>Fulfilled prophecy is the testimony of the centuries to the
living God. The evidence of prophecy and its fulfilment is
God's challenge and appeal to men to acknowledge Him as
the true God and the Holy Scriptures as His word from heaven.</p>

<p>"I have declared the former things from the beginning;
and they went forth out of My mouth, and I showed them;
I did them suddenly, and they came to pass. Because I
knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew,
and thy brow brass; I have even from the beginning declared
it to thee; before it came to pass I showed it thee.... Thou
hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it?" Isa.
48:3-6.</p>

<p>Surely no one can look at the evidence in history of the
fulfilment of prophecy without seeing that of a truth the
One who spoke these words knew the end from the beginning;
and finding the living God in the sure word of prophecy,
one must be prepared to listen to His voice in all the
Scriptures, when it speaks of sin and the way of salvation
through Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Further, the prophetic word also has much to say of
events yet future, of the course of history in modern times.
It behooves us to give heed to what that word speaks concerning
our own times and the events that are to take place
upon the earth before the end. The apostle Peter exhorts
us to the study in these words:</p>

<p>"We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto
ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in
a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in
your hearts." 2 Peter 1:19.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE PROPHECY OF DANIEL 2</h3>


<p>"There is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and
maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be
in the latter days."</p>

<p>In a dream by night the Lord gave to Nebuchadnezzar,
king of Babylon, a clear historical outline of the course of
world empire to the end of time and the coming of the eternal
kingdom.</p>

<p>The king was a thoughtful monarch; and having reached
the height of his power, he was one night meditating upon
"what should come to pass hereafter." Not for his sake
alone, but for the enlightenment and instruction of men in
all time, the Lord answered the wondering question of the
king's meditation by giving him the dream. "He that revealeth
secrets," said Daniel the prophet, "maketh known
to thee what shall come to pass."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>And that we may know at the beginning that there is
nothing fanciful and uncertain about this great historic
outline reaching to the end of the world, we note first the
assurance with which the prophet closed his interpretation:
"The dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure."</p>

<p>The details of the dream had been taken from the king's
mind, while conviction as to the wondrous import of it remained.
This was in God's providence, to show the folly
of the worldly-wise men of Babylon, and to bring before the
king the prophet of the Lord with a divine message. The
prophet Daniel, under the inspiration of God, brought his
dream again to the king's mind:</p>

<p>"Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This
great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before
thee; and the form thereof was terrible.</p>

<p>"This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his
arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron,
his feet part of iron and part of clay.</p>

<p>"Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands,
which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and
clay, and brake them to pieces. Then was the iron, the
clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together,
and became like the chaff of the summer threshing
floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was
found for them: and the stone that smote the image became
a great mountain, and filled the whole earth."</p>

<p>The prophet next declared the interpretation. And now
follows the history of the world in miniature.</p>


<h4>Babylon</h4>

<p>"Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven
hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.
And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the
field and the fowls of the heaven hath He given into thine
hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art
this head of gold."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>The parts of the image, then, of various metals, from
head to feet, represented successive empires, beginning with
Babylon; and the kingdom of Babylon, represented by Nebuchadnezzar,
was the head of gold.</p>

<p>History shows how fitly the golden head symbolizes the
Babylonian kingdom. Long before, the prophet Isaiah had
described it as "the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the
Chaldees' excellency." Isa. 13:19. And now, in Nebuchadnezzar's
day, it was the golden age of the Babylonian kingdom.
No such gorgeous city as its capital ever before stood
on earth. And Nebuchadnezzar was the great leader of its
conquests, and the beautifier and builder of its walls and
palaces. "For the astonishment of men I have built this
house," one tablet reads; and hundreds repeat the story.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Those portals<br /></span>

<span class="i0">what no king before me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">had done."&mdash;<i>East India House Inscription.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus Nebuchadnezzar's records of stone today repeat the
proud boast faithfully reported in the Scripture, "Is not this
great Babylon, that I have built?" Dan. 4:30. To the
king it seemed that such a city could never fall. One inscription
reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Thus I completely made strong the defenses of Babylon. May it
last forever."&mdash;<i>Rawlinson, "Fourth Monarchy," Appendix A.</i></p></div>


<h4>Medo-Persia</h4>

<p>But the prophet Daniel, proceeding with the divine interpretation,
interrupted all such proud thoughts with the declaration,
"After thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to
thee."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the look was forward into the future. And the word
came to pass. Babylon's decline was swift after Nebuchadnezzar's
death. Daniel the prophet himself lived to interpret
the handwriting on the wall at Belshazzar's feast:</p>

<p>"God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it....
Thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting....
Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and
Persians." Dan. 5:26-28.</p>

<p>The breast and arms of silver, in the great image, represented
the Medo-Persian kingdom, which followed the Babylonian,
"inferior" to it in brilliancy and grandeur, as silver
is inferior to gold. Medo-Persia, however, enlarged the borders
of the world empire; and the names of Cyrus and Darius
are written among the mightiest conquerors of history.</p>

<p>But the prophet does not stop to dwell upon the grandeur
of fleeting earthly kingdoms. The interpretation hastens
on to reach the setting up of a kingdom that shall not pass
away. Following Medo-Persia, a third power was to rise,</p>


<h4>Grecia</h4>

<p>"And another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear
rule over all the earth."</p>

<p>The "third kingdom" after Babylon was Grecia, which
overthrew the empire of the Medes and Persians. And
Grecia's dominion fulfilled the specifications of the prophecy,
which indicated a yet wider expansion of empire. Its sway
was to be over "all the earth," said Daniel the prophet, foretelling
its history. Arrian, the Greek historian, writing afterward,
said that Alexander of Greece seemed truly "lord of
all the earth;" and he adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am persuaded there was no nation, city, nor people then in being
whither his name did not reach; for which reason, whatever origin he
might boast of, or claim to himself, there seems to me to have been some
divine hand presiding both over his birth and actions."&mdash;<i>"History of the
Expedition of Alexander the Great," book 7, chap. 30.</i></p></div>

<p>The sides of brass in the great image represented Grecia,
the brazen metal itself being a fitting symbol of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
"brazen-mailed" Greeks, celebrated in ancient poetry and
song,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Among the foremost, armed in glittering brass."</p></div>


<h4>A Power Rising in the West</h4>

<p>While Grecia's supremacy under Alexander was disputed
by none, there was a power rising in the West that was soon
to enter the lists for the prize of world dominion.</p>

<p>Some of the ancient writers say that at the time of his
death Alexander had in mind to push westward to strike down
the growing power of the city of Rome, of which he had heard.
Plutarch says that this man Alexander,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"who shot like a star, with incredible swiftness, from the rising to the
setting sun, was meditating to bring the luster of his arms into Italy....
He had heard of the Roman power in Italy."&mdash;<i>"Morals," chap. on
"Fortune of the Romans," par. 13.</i></p></div>

<p>Lucan, the ancient Roman poet, repeats the thought:</p>

<p>But in the prime of his years, Alexander was cut down,
and Rome had yet more time in which to develop its strength
preparatory to the deciding contest for the mastery of all the
world. Sure it is that after Grecia, there followed the Roman
Empire, the strongest and mightiest and most crushing of
them all. This fourth universal empire the prophet proceeded
to describe, as represented by the legs of iron in Nebuchadnezzar's
dream of the great image.</p>


<h4>Rome</h4>

<p>"The fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch
as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron
that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>How appropriately the iron of the image fits the character
of the fourth great empire! Gibbon, the historian, calls it
"the iron monarchy of Rome." It broke in pieces the kingdoms,
subduing all, just as prophecy had declared so long
before. As iron is strongest of the common metals, so according
to the prophecy&mdash;"as iron that breaketh all these"&mdash;this
fourth kingdom was to be more powerful than any before
it. Strabo, the geographer, who lived in the days of Tiberius
C&aelig;sar, said,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Romans have surpassed (in power) all former rulers of whom
we have any record."&mdash;<i>"Geography," book 17, chap. 3.</i></p></div>

<p>Hippolytus, bishop and martyr, who lived in Rome in
the third century,&mdash;under the "iron monarchy,"&mdash;wrote thus
of this prophecy:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Already the iron rules; already it subdues and breaks all in pieces;
already it brings all the unwilling into subjection; already we see these
things ourselves."&mdash;<i>"Treatise on Christ and Antichrist," sec. 33.</i></p></div>

<p>Hippolytus also saw clearly from the prophecy that the
empire of his day would be divided, and he wrote of the kingdoms
that were "yet to rise" out of it. For Daniel's interpretation
explained clearly the meaning of the mingling of
clay with the iron in the feet and toes of the great image.</p>


<h4>The Kingdoms of Modern Europe</h4>

<p>"Whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters'
clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there
shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou
sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</p>

<p>"And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of
clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</p>

<p>"And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay,
they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they
shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed
with clay."</p>

<p>"The kingdom shall be divided." So declared the prophet
of God. In the height of its power, Rome scouted the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
thought that so mighty a fabric could ever be broken up.

<p>But the words were written on the ancient parchment in
the days of Babylon, "The kingdom shall be divided;" and
true to the word of the prophet, the Roman Empire fell apart
with the mixture of nations and peoples that swept into it.
The elements did not hold together, even as the mixture of
iron and clay in the image did not cleave together. Broken
up by the invasions of fresh nations from the north, the Western
Empire was divided into lesser kingdoms, out of which
have grown the modern nations of western Europe.</p>

<p>Not one word in the outline of the prophecy thus far has
failed of fulfilment. These modern kingdoms growing out
of divided Rome have never been reunited. "They shall
mingle themselves with the seed of men," said the prophecy.
Nearly all the reigning houses of Europe today are related by
intermarriage; the prophecy said it would be so; but "they
shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with
clay." So we see it. No statesman, no master of legions, has
been able to join these nations together again in one great
empire. Charles V had the thought in mind, some think.
Napoleon dreamed of doing it. But it was not to be. Nevermore
was there to be one universal monarchy.</p>

<p>We may know that as surely as the course of world empire
has followed the exact outline of the prophecy put on the inspired
record in the days of Babylon of old, just so surely the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
specifications of the closing portion of the outline will be fulfilled.</p>

<p>The fourth great kingdom was to be divided. Rome was
the fourth empire: it was divided. The kingdoms of the divided
empire are acting their part before our eyes today.</p>


<h4>The Next Great Event</h4>

<p>And what next? That is the question for us. Now the
prophetic outline that began with ancient Babylon touches the
things of our own day. The word spoken before Nebuchadnezzar
so long ago is now spoken especially to us:</p>

<p>"In the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set
up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom
shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in
pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.</p>

<p>"Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of
the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the
iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great
God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass
hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation
thereof sure."</p>

<p>"In the days of these kings,"&mdash;these kingdoms of our
own time,&mdash;the next great world-changing event is to be the
coming of Christ to begin the setting up of his everlasting
kingdom. That is the grand climax toward which all the
course of history has been tending. At last the end is to come.</p>

</div></div>

<p>As the stone, cut out of the mountain "without hands,"
smote the image, so that all its parts, representative of earthly
dominion, were ground to dust and blown away, so Christ's
coming kingdom, set up "without hands," by no human

<h2>THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST</h2>


<p>"Unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second
time without sin unto salvation." Heb. 9:28.</p>

<p>Too often the second coming of Christ is looked upon
simply as a doctrine. It is, however, more than a doctrine
merely to be believed; it is an impending event, something
that is to take place on earth, and the most stupendous, all-transcendent
event for the world since Christ came the first
time to die on Calvary for the sins of men.</p>

<p>This second coming of Christ, like His first coming, has
been the theme of divine prophecy from the beginning. This
was emphasized by the apostle Peter in his second recorded
sermon. He pressed upon the people of Jerusalem the fact
that the things "which God before had showed by the mouth
of all His prophets, that Christ should suffer" (Acts 3:18),
had been fulfilled to the letter before their eyes. Not a word
had failed. Just so, he said, all that the prophets had spoken
of His second coming would be fulfilled:</p>

<p>"He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached
unto you: whom the heaven must receive until the times of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth
of all His holy prophets since the world began." Acts 3:20, 21.</p>


<h4>The Promise of His Coming</h4>

<p>As iniquity began to abound, God sent a message to the
antediluvian world, declaring that Christ's coming in glory
would end the reign of sin:</p>

<p>"Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His
saints, to execute judgment upon all." Jude 14, 15.</p>

<p>The promise of Christ's coming was the "blessed hope"
in the patriarchal age. In Job's dark hour of trial his heart
clung to the promise, and he was kept from despair:</p>

<p>"I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall
stand at the latter day upon the earth: ... whom I shall see
for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another."
Job 19:25-27.</p>

<p>The psalmist sang of it:</p>

<p>"Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire
shall devour before Him, and it shall be very tempestuous
round about Him." Ps. 50:3.</p>

<p>And the prophets of later times were unceasingly moved
upon to talk of the glory of that coming, of events preceding
it, and of the preparation for it.</p>

<p>"I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which
shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention
of the Lord, keep not silence." "Behold, the Lord hath
proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter
of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, His reward is
with Him, and His work before Him." Isa. 62:6, 11.</p>

<p>The message of His coming is to be heralded to the ends
of the earth; for it is "good tidings of great joy" to every
one who will receive it.</p>

<p>On that last night with His disciples before the crucifixion,
when His heart was sorrowful even unto death, as the burden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
of all our iniquities was about to be laid upon Him, Christ's
love for His own made precious to Him the thought of His
second coming to gather them home at last, safe from all sin
and trouble; and He said:</p>

<p>"Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe
also in Me. In My Father's house are many mansions:
if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a
place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will
come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am,
there ye may be also." John 14:1-3.</p>

<p>In that assurance the heart finds rest. O the preciousness
of the promise, "I will come again"! "I am coming for you,"
is the cheering message. "Yes, Lord," we reply, "we will
wait, and watch, and be ready, by Thy grace."</p>


<h4>The Manner of His Coming</h4>

<p>Christ's second coming is to be visible to all the world.
There is to be nothing secret or mystical about it. The revelator
says:</p>

<p>"Behold, He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see
Him." Rev. 1:7.</p>

<p>Christ Himself described the scene to His disciples as it
will appear to the eyes of all:</p>

<p>"As the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth
even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of
man be." Matt. 24:27. "Then shall they see the Son of
man coming in the clouds with great power and glory." Mark
13:26.</p>

<p>The day of the Lord&mdash;the close of probation, the initial
outpouring of the judgments of God&mdash;will come "as a thief
in the night," but Christ's personal appearing will be visible
to all. The heavens will open, the earth quake, the trump
of God resound, and such glory as mortal eye has never seen
will burst upon the world when He comes as King of kings
and Lord of lords.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h4>"This Same Jesus"</h4>

<p>The Lord would have His children understand that this
One who comes in power and glory is the same Saviour of
men who once walked by blue Galilee. As the disciples were
watching their Saviour, and ours, ascending bodily into heaven
from Olivet, until "a cloud received Him out of their sight,"
suddenly two angels stood by them, who said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven,
shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into
heaven." Acts 1:9, 11.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/p055.jpg" width="448" height="289" alt="CHRIST SET AT NAUGHT

<span class="caption">CHRIST SET AT NAUGHT
BY THE ROMANS<br />

&quot;Behold your King!&quot; John 19:14.</span>
</div>

<p>"This same Jesus"! It was the loving Friend and Elder
Brother, Son of man as well as Son of God, who was passing
from their sight. He will come back the "same Jesus,"
though in glory indescribable, having "all the holy angels
with Him."</p>

<p>The prophet Habakkuk thus described Christ's glorious
appearing, as it was represented to him in vision:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His glory covered the heavens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the earth was full of His praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And His brightness was as the light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had rays coming forth from His hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was the hiding of His power."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hab. 3:3, 4, A.R.V.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Surely it is the "same Jesus," and the mark of the cruel nails
is the shining badge of His power to save.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I shall know Him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the print of the nails in His hands."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As the redeemed see Him who was crucified for them coming
in glory, they will cry, "Lo, this is our God; we have
waited for Him, and He will save us: this is the Lord; we
have waited for Him, we will be glad and rejoice in His
salvation." Isa. 25:9.</p>

<p>But that day will be a day of darkness as well as of light.
The unready, the unrepentant, will realize too late that in
rejecting Christ's pardon and love and sacrifice, they have
rejected the only means by which they might have been prepared
to meet the coming King, before whose face no sin can
endure. "Every eye shall see Him," the apostle says, and
he describes the terror of that day to the unprepared:</p>

<p>"The kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich
men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every
bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and
in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and
rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth
on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the
great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to
stand?" Rev. 6:15-17.</p>

<p>The scenes of that great day are so beyond human comprehension
that it is difficult to realize that such a time is
actually before us.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then, O my Lord, prepare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My soul for that great day."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h4>The Purpose of His Coming</h4>

<p>The Scriptures make very clear the purpose of Christ's
second coming and the events of that great day. It has been
the hope of the children of God through all the ages. The
apostle Paul calls it the "blessed hope."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>"The grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared
to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly
lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this
present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious
appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ."
Titus 2:11-13.</p>

<p>The saints of God have fallen asleep in death with their
faith reaching forward to Christ's glorious appearing. So the
veteran apostle fell, with eyes upon "that day."</p>

<p>"I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure
is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished
my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is
laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the
righteous Judge, shall give me at that day: and not to
me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing."
2 Tim. 4:6-8.</p>

<p>Christ's second coming is the grand climax of the plan of
salvation. Not till then are the children of God ushered into
the eternal kingdom. Then the crowns of life are bestowed,
and the saved all go together through the gates into the city&mdash;patriarch
and prophet, apostle and reformer, and the child
of God of this last generation. Of the ancient worthies it is
written:</p>

<p>"These all, having obtained a good report through faith,
received not the promise: God having provided some better
thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."
Heb. 11:39, 40.</p>

<p>What a glorious day it will be when the ransomed of all
the ages, march in together through the gates into the city!</p>

<p>It is to take His children to their eternal home that Christ
comes the second time. This was His promise to the disciples:</p>

<p>"I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare
a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself;
that where I am, there ye may be also." John 14:2, 3.</p>

<p>Not in detail, but in their general order, let us follow the
events of that great day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<h4>The Prelude to His Coming</h4>

<p>as the revelator saw it and heard it in a vision of the last
day:</p>

<p>"There came a great voice out of the temple of heaven,
from the throne, saying, It is done. And there were voices,
and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake,
such as was not since men were upon the earth,...
and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in
remembrance before God." Rev. 16:17-19.</p>

<p>"The heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together;
and every mountain and island were moved out of
their places." Rev. 6:14.</p>


<h4>His Glorious Appearing</h4>

<p>Then bursts upon the world the glory of our Saviour's
coming:</p>

<p>"Then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven:
and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they
shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with
power and great glory. And He shall send His angels with
a great sound of a trumpet." Matt. 24:30, 31.</p>

<p>"I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud
one sat like unto the Son of man, having on His head a golden
crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle. And another angel
came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him that
sat on the cloud, Thrust in Thy sickle, and reap: for the
time is come for Thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth
is ripe." Rev. 14:14, 15.</p>


<h4>The Resurrection of the Just, and the Translation
of the Living Righteous</h4>

<p>The time to reap has come, and the wheat is gathered at
last into the garner of the Lord:</p>

<p>"We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a
moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,
and we shall be changed." 1 Cor. 15:51, 52.</p>

<p>"He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet,
and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds,
from one end of heaven to the other." Matt. 24:31.</p>

<p>"This we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we
which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord Himself
shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the
Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ
shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be
caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord
in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore
comfort one another with these words." 1 Thess. 4:15-18.</p>

<p>The righteous dead are raised to life as the trump of God
sounds and the voice of the Archangel calls to His sleeping
saints, and the living righteous are transformed from mortality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
to immortality. Then all together, with the escort of the
angels, they follow the Saviour to the heavenly mansions that
He has prepared in the city of God.</p>


<h4>The Destruction of the Wicked</h4>

<p>Before the glorious majesty of the coming King no sin can
endure; for true it is that "our God is a consuming fire"&mdash;now,
in the day of His mercy, consuming sin out of the heart
that by faith approaches the throne of grace, but in that
day consuming the unrepentant sinner with his sin.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where will the sinner hide in that day, in that day?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where will the sinner hide in that day?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It will be in vain to call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Ye mountains on us fall!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For His hand will find out all in that day."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is the great day long foretold by seer and prophet.</p>

<p>Again let us read the description of what it will mean to
the unsaved to see Christ coming in glory; for the terror of
that day must warn us now to keep within the refuge of the
Saviour's loving grace:</p>

<p>"The kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich
men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every
bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and
in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains
and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that
sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for
the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to
stand?" Rev. 6:15-17.</p>

<p>The same glory that transforms the righteous is a consuming
fire to those who have rejected Christ's salvation:</p>

<p>"Then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord
shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy
with the brightness of His coming." 2 Thess. 2:8.</p>

<p>"When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with
His mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord
Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting destruction
from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory
of His power." 2 Thess. 1:7-9.</p>


<h4>The Climax of Human History</h4>

<p>Thus the second coming of Christ brings the resurrection
and translation of the righteous, the death of the wicked, and
the end of the world. The resurrection of the wicked does
not then take place, but only that of the just; save for some
of the wicked dead who had a special part in warring against
Christ,&mdash;"they also which pierced Him" (Rev. 1:7). These
are raised to see His coming, necessarily to fall again before
the consuming glory of His presence.</p>

<p>The righteous are taken to reign with Christ in the heavenly
city for a thousand years, and during the same period
the earth lies in desolation and chaos, uninhabited by man, a
dark abyss, the dreary prison house of Satan. Of the two
resurrections, first of the just and then of the unjust, we
are told:</p>

<p>"They [the righteous] lived and reigned with Christ a
thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again
until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first
resurrection: on such the second death hath no power." Rev.
20:4-6.</p>

<p>It is at the end of the thousand years that the resurrection
of the wicked takes place. Then the city of God descends,
"the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from
God out of heaven," and the wicked come forth to condemnation
and the second death, from which there is no waking.</p>


<h4>"Now is the Accepted Time"</h4>

<p>Now is the day of salvation, when by Christ's grace we
may prepare for that great day. To be found among His
redeemed ones in that day will be of infinitely greater worth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
than anything this world can give, of pleasure, or possessions,
or honor. Nothing will count then but the blessed hope.</p>

<p>Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, found the personal Saviour
in the days of the Methodist revival in England. All
her wealth and all her social influence were devoted to Christ,
even though titled friends took umbrage at her close association
with the poor and the humble who gave heed to the
message of the hour, and pressed into the kingdom. She
wrote of her joy in being numbered with the children of God:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I love to meet among them now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before Thy gracious throne to bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though weakest of them all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor can I bear the piercing thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have my worthless name left out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Thou for them shalt call.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Prevent, prevent it by Thy grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be Thou, dear Lord, my hiding place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that expected day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy pardoning voice, O let me hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To still each unbelieving fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor let me fall, I pray."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One night, at a royal ball, the Prince of Wales asked a
titled lady where the Countess of Huntingdon was. "Oh, I
suppose she is praying with some of her beggars somewhere!"
was the flippant answer. "Ah," said the crown prince, "in
the last day I think I should be glad to hold the hem of Lady
Huntingdon's mantle." True it is that the greatest gift of
grace now, as it will be then, is to be numbered among the
obedient children of God.</p>

<h2><a name="SIGNS_OF_THE_APPROACHING_END" id="SIGNS_OF_THE_APPROACHING_END"></a>SIGNS OF THE APPROACHING END</h2>


<h3>OUR SAVIOUR'S GREAT PROPHECY</h3>

<h4>Part I</h4>

<p>Christ had spoken of the coming desolation of the sacred
temple at Jerusalem. The disciples were astonished. "Master,
see," said one, "what manner of stones and what buildings
are here!" The Saviour replied:</p>

<p>"Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left
one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down"
Mark 13:2.</p>


<h4>"What Shall be the Sign?"</h4>

<p>As soon as they were alone on the Mount of Olives overlooking
the city, the disciples came to Jesus, saying:</p>

<p>"Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be
the sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world?" Matt.
24:3.</p>

<p>Replying to this question, the Saviour spoke first of the
fall of Jerusalem; He foretold in a sentence the experiences of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
His church through dark ages to follow; then He described
the events of the latter days, the signs showing His second
advent near at hand; and, finally, He pictured the scenes of
His own glorious appearing in the clouds of heaven. The
fullest record of the discourse is found in the twenty-fourth
chapter of Matthew.</p>


<h4>A Striking Parallel</h4>

<p>The first portion of the prophetic discourse (verses 4-14)
deals with general conditions that were to prevail both in the
last days of the Jewish state, and on a yet larger scale in the
course of history leading to the last days of the world. There
was so close a parallel between these times that Christ, in one
description, answered both questions asked, When shall these
things come upon Jerusalem? and, What shall be the signs
of the end of the world?</p>

<p>The prophetic word foretold the rise of false Christs, the
coming of wars, famines, and earthquakes in "divers places."
The believers saw these things fulfilled in that generation before
Jerusalem fell; but as we read the prophecy, we see the
wider application and yet larger fulfilment through the course
of history since that day, these calamities increasing in the
earth as the end draws near. Before the end of the Jewish
state, the believers carried the gospel to all the known world
of their day. (See Col. 1:23.) In these latter days we are
seeing the yet wider proclamation of the gospel, as foretold
in the fourteenth verse, "This gospel of the kingdom shall
be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations;
and then shall the end come."</p>


<h4>The Last Days of Jerusalem</h4>

<p>We may note briefly some of the events of Jerusalem's
last days. Christ had forewarned the believers:</p>

<p>"Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall
come in My name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive
many."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>Having rejected the true Christ, the nation was open to
deception by the false. We catch just a glimpse of the fulfilment
in the book of Acts; in secular history the full story is
told. Ridpath says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Never was a people so turbulent, so excited with expectation of a
deliverer who should restore the ancient kingdom, so fired with bigotry
and fanaticism, as were the wretched Jews of this period. One Christ
came after another. Revolt was succeeded by revolt, instigated by some
pseudo-prophet or pretended king."&mdash;<i>"History of the World," Vol. I, p. 849
(Part III, chap. 19).</i></p></div>

<p>During the Saviour's life and ministry a divine hand had
to a great extent held the elements of violence in check, but
as the light was rejected more and more, the spirit of evil
came to hold sway unrestrained. Dr. Mears well describes
the changed conditions in these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The narrative of the evangelists presents a tranquil scene, a succession
of attractive pictures, in striking contrast to the bloody and tumultuous
events which crowd each other in the pages of Josephus."&mdash;<i>"From
Exile to Overthrow," pp. 256, 257.</i></p></div>

<p>Thus the events led rapidly on toward the day of Jerusalem's
fall, so long foretold by the prophets.</p>


<h4>The Sign to the Believers</h4>

<p>The disciples had asked for a sign, and Christ gave them
a token by which they might know when the time to flee
from Jerusalem had come. Here Luke's Gospel gives the
fullest record:</p>

<p>"When ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then
know that the desolation thereof is nigh. Then let them
which are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let them which
are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are
in the countries enter thereinto. For these be the days of
vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled."
Luke 21:20-22.</p>

<span class="caption">THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM BY THE
ROMANS UNDER TITUS, A.D. 70<br />

&quot;When ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then
know that the desolation thereof is nigh.&quot; Luke 21:20.</span>
</div>

<p>The unbelieving in Jerusalem and Judea could not conceive
that their city, so long protected and favored of God,
could be destroyed. Not even the appearance of the Roman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>armies could shake their blind self-confidence. But at the
first sight of the encircling armies, the Christians knew that
the time for flight was at hand. But how to flee was the question,
with the compassing lines drawn close about the city.
Moreover, the Zealots, the furious war party in power, would
be little likely to allow any number to pass out to the Roman
forces.</p>

<p>Just here God's providence made a way of escape. Cestius,
the Roman commander, after having partially undermined
one of the temple walls, suddenly decided to defer pushing
the attack. "He retired from the city," says Josephus,
"without any reason in the world." (See "Wars," book 2,
chap. 19.) And the Zealots flew out after the retiring Romans,
furiously attacking the rear guards.</p>

<p>Then those watching Christians knew that the time for
quick flight had come, according to Christ's prophecy uttered
many years before. They fled out of the city and out of the
country round about.</p>

<p>Through all the years, Christ's prophecy had exhorted
them, "Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither
on the Sabbath day." Matt. 24:20. The prayer was answered,
for it was in the autumn and on a week day that the
flight was made.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Watching for the sign, and instantly obeying,
they were delivered.</p>

<p>Thus it was that when the Romans returned later to the
siege, never to give up till the city fell, none of the Christians
were overwhelmed in its destruction. Even so are we to
watch the signs of our own times, that we may escape those
things that are coming upon the earth, and be ready to "stand
before the Son of man."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>


<h4>The Prophetic Word Fulfilled</h4>

<p>Christ had declared that the temple, the pride of the nation,
would be utterly destroyed. In the last siege, the Roman
commander tried to spare the magnificent pile. When
the Jews made it their chief fortress, because of its massive
strength, Titus remonstrated with them, saying:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If you will but change the place whereon you fight, no Roman
shall either come near your sanctuary, or offer any affront to it; nay, I
will endeavor to preserve you your holy house, whether you will or
not."&mdash;<i>Josephus, "Wars of the Jews," book 6, chap. 2.</i></p></div>

<p>But the prophecy was fulfilled to the letter. The people
seemed possessed with fury. The hardened Roman pagans
were astonished at their suicidal rashness. Titus's efforts to
save the temple failed, and it went down in ruin, as Christ
had foretold.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 443px;">
<img src="images/p070.jpg" width="443" height="288" alt="A PANEL FROM THE

<span class="caption">A PANEL FROM THE

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>The disciples of Christ had called His attention to the immense
blocks of stone that composed the temple walls. "See,
what manner of stones," one said. When Titus examined
these same stones, after the fall of the city, he is said to have
declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We have certainly had God for our assistant in this war, and it was
no other than God who ejected the Jews out of these
fortifications."<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>&mdash;<i>Id., book 6, chap. 9.</i></p></div>

<p>Rather, we would say, in the light of Scripture teaching,
the destruction that came upon the city was but the fruit of
its own way. God's guardian care had long protected the
city of David. When His protection was finally thrust aside
and the people put themselves in the power of the great destroyer,
divine justice could no longer save the city from the
judgments that were bound to fall upon persistent transgression
against light.</p>

<p>The lesson is one of those written "for our admonition
upon whom the ends of the world are come." Jerusalem, in
that generation of great light and high privilege, fell because
it knew not the time of its visitation. Still Christ's sad lament
bears its warning to the ears of men: "If thou hadst
known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which
belong unto thy peace!" Luke 19:42.</p>


<h4>Part II</h4>

<p>Having foretold the destruction of Jerusalem, and given
to the believers signs by which they might find deliverance
in the day of its overthrow, Christ yet more fully answered
the second part of the disciples' question, "What shall be the
sign of Thy coming, and of the end of the world?" Matt.

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>


<h4>The Period of Tribulation</h4>

<p>Quickly He passed to the events of the latter days. But
first He sketched, in a few words, the tribulations through
which His church was to pass during the intervening centuries.
Daniel the prophet had written of this experience, foretelling
the long period during which the papal power was to
"wear out the saints of the Most High." Dan. 7:25. Of
these times, Christ said in His prophetic discourse:</p>

<p>"Then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since
the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.
And except those days should be shortened, there should no
flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be
shortened." Matt. 24:21, 22.</p>

<p>It is evident that Christ referred to the time of tribulation
foretold by Daniel, not to the trials attending the flight of
the Christians from Jerusalem, for their flight was a deliverance
of the elect from trial. However much the weak may
have suffered temporarily in fleeing from their homes, the
great suffering of that time came upon the unbelieving, who
had no shelter.</p>

<p>This prophecy given by our Saviour presents the picture
of a long-continued persecution of His own elect, and foretells
the shortening of the allotted time. God was to intervene
in some special way to save His people. And it was
even so. The elect did suffer all through the centuries of
intolerance, until the rise of the Reformation and the spreading
abroad of God's Word broke the power of ecclesiasticism,
thus shortening the days of bitter tribulation.</p>


<h4>The End Drawing Near</h4>

<p>According to Daniel's further prophecy, the period of trial
and persecution was to reach "even to the time of the end."
Dan. 11:35. Naturally, then, we should look for the signs
of the latter days to begin to appear following these days of
tribulation. And so we find the next words of Christ's discourse
introducing the topic of His second coming. From<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
now on the prophetic outline deals with events leading down
to the end of the age.</p>

<p>First the Saviour utters a warning against false ideas concerning
His second coming. That no theories of a secret
coming or of a mystic coming might deceive the unwary,
He says in plain words:</p>

<p>"If any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or
there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and
false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch
that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very
elect. Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore if they
shall say unto you, Behold, He is in the desert; go not forth:
behold, He is in the secret chambers; believe it not. For as
the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto
the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be."
Matt. 24:23-27.</p>

<p>Today we see the need of this warning. Some of the most
subtle deceptions are found in the teaching that Christ has
already come, secretly, or that He comes in the chamber of
death, or in the spiritualistic s&eacute;ance. Against all these errors
we are forewarned, as well as against any agencies that may
come showing marvelous signs and wonders. The close of
human probation, the coming of the day of God, will be as a
thief in the night; and Christ's coming itself will overtake the
unwatchful all unprepared. Nevertheless, when He comes,
"every eye shall see Him," and all the glory of heaven will
burst upon a quaking world.</p>


<h4>Signs in the Heavens and the Earth</h4>

<p>Now the Saviour's outline of prophecy presents the signs
which were to show when the coming of the Lord was near.
Referring again to the days of tribulation foretold by the
prophet Daniel, Christ says:</p>

<p>"Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the
sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and
the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
shall be shaken: and then shall appear the sign of the Son of
man in heaven." Matt. 24:29, 30.</p>

<p>In Luke's record of the same prophetic discourse, additional
signs are given, describing conditions in the earth as
Christ's coming draws near. His account reads:</p>

<p>"There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and
in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity;
the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing
them for fear, and for looking after those things which are
coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud
with power and great glory. And when these things begin
to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for
your redemption draweth nigh." Luke 21:25-28.</p>

<p>Yet again, the prophet John, in the Revelation, foretells
these signs in the sun and moon and stars, as they were presented
to him in a vision of the last days. But his record
shows that this series of signs was to be preceded by a great
earthquake. He describes the order of events as follows:</p>

<p>"I beheld when He had opened the sixth seal, and, lo,
there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as
sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; and the
stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth
her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind."
Rev. 6:12, 13.</p>

<p>In these scriptures four great signs of Christ's approaching
advent are listed for our study, as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. The great earthquake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">2. The darkening of the sun and moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">3. The falling of the stars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">4. Distress of nations, and other signs.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>The Time When the Signs Begin</h4>

<p>Christ's prophecy points out approximately the time
when the first of the signs that He gave, the darkening of
the sun, should appear,&mdash;"immediately after the tribulation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of those days." And the "great earthquake" of John's vision
was to precede this sign in the heavens.</p>

<p>The Reformation of the sixteenth century began to cut
short the days of tribulation; but some countries shut out
the liberalizing influences of the Word of God, and there the
persecution continued.</p>

<p>Even as late as near the end of the seventeenth century,
in 1685, France revoked the Edict of Nantes, that had
granted toleration, and persecution raged as of old. The
church was driven again to the desert. Speaking of the early
decades of the eighteenth century, Kurtz says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In France the persecution of the Huguenots continued.... The
'pastors of the desert' performed their duties at the risk of their
lives."&mdash;<i>"Church
History," Vol. III, p. 88.</i></p></div>

<p>There was severe persecution of the Moravians in Austria,
in these times, many of the persecuted finding refuge in Saxony.
It was in 1722 that Christian David led the first band
of Moravian refugees to settle on the estates of Count Zinzendorf,
who organized through them the great pioneer movement
of modern missions.</p>

<p>But by the middle of the century, the era of enlightenment
and the force of world opinion, in the good providence
of God, had so permeated the Catholic states of Europe that
general violent persecution had ceased. One incident will
suffice as evidence of this.</p>

<p>The scene was in France, where alone, of all the Catholic
states, there were any great numbers of Protestants. In 1762
a Huguenot of Toulouse, unjustly charged with crime, was
put to torture and to death, under the pressure of the old
persecuting spirit. Many Huguenots thought the persecutions
of former times were reviving, and prepared to flee to
Switzerland. But Voltaire took up the matter, and so wrought
upon public opinion that the Paris parliament reviewed the
case, and the king paid the man's family a large indemnity.</p>

<p>This shows that by the middle of that century the days
of any general persecution had ceased. In the nature of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
case, we may not point to the exact year and say, Here the
days of tribulation ended.</p>

<p>From these times, then, we are to scan the record of history
to learn if the appointed signs began to appear. As we
look, we find the events recorded, following on in the order
predicted:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. The Lisbon earthquake, cf 1755.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">2. The dark day, cf 1780.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">4. General conditions and movements betokening the end.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"There shall be signs," the Saviour said. We are to study
the record of events, watching to catch the signs of the approaching
end as earnestly as the mariner watches the beacon
lights when he nears the longed-for haven on a dark and
stormy night.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> It was in the autumn that the army of Cestius closed in upon
Jerusalem.
According to the careful record of Graetz, the Jewish historian, it was
evidently
on a Wednesday that the Roman army retired, pursued by all the forces
of the city. This was the instant for the flight of the Christians. Next day
"the Zealots, shouting exultant war songs, returned to Jerusalem (8th
October)."&mdash;<i>"History

testimony to
the latter's conviction that there was something supernatural about the forces

and when the country all round was filled with corpses, the neighboring races
offered him a crown: but he disclaimed any such honor to himself, saying that
it was not he himself that had accomplished this exploit, but that he had
merely lent his arms to God, who had so manifested His wrath."&mdash;<i>Philostratus,

<h4>"Lo, There Was a Great Earthquake"</h4>

<p>The first of a series of signs of the approaching end is
thus described by the revelator:</p>

<p>"I beheld when He had opened the sixth seal, and, lo,
there was a great earthquake." Rev. 6:12.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">

<span class="caption">THE LISBON EARTHQUAKE<br />

&quot;There shall be famines, and pestilences, and
earthquakes, in divers places.&quot; Matt. 24:7.</span>
</div>

<p>The verses immediately preceding this scripture plainly
describe the days of persecution of the saints of God, and the
era of protest and reform that cut short that time of tribulation.
Then this first sign appears. This is in harmony with
Christ's statement that the signs of His second coming should
begin to appear following the tribulation of those days.</p>

<p>Just about the close of the days of tribulation occurred
the Lisbon earthquake, as it is called, though its effects
reached far beyond Portugal. Prof. W.H. Hobbs, geologist,
says of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Among the earth movements which in historic times have affected
the kingdom of Portugal, that of Nov. 1, 1755, takes first rank, as it does,
also, in some respects, among all recorded earthquakes.... In six minutes
sixty thousand people perished."&mdash;<i>"Earthquakes," pp. 142, 143.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lo, there was a great earthquake," the revelator said.
It was indeed "a great earthquake," and great was its influence.
In all the world, men's hearts were mightily stirred.
James Parton, an English author, says of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Lisbon earthquake of Nov. 1, 1755, appears to have put both
the theologians and philosophers on the defensive.... At twenty minutes
to ten that morning, Lisbon was firm and magnificent, on one of the most
picturesque and commanding sites in the world,&mdash;a city of superb approach,
placed precisely where every circumstance had concurred to say
to the founders, Build here! In six minutes the city was in ruins....
Half the world felt the convulsion.... For many weeks, as we see in the
letters and memoirs of that time, people in distant parts of Europe went
to bed in alarm, relieved in the morning to find that they had escaped the
fate of Lisbon one night more."&mdash;<i>"Life of Voltaire," Vol. II, pp. 208,
209.</i></p></div>


<h4>The World Set to Thinking</h4>

<p>This earthquake set men to thinking of the great day of
God. Voltaire, the French philosopher, was "profoundly
moved" by it, we are told. "It was the last judgment for
that region," he wrote; "nothing was wanting to it except
the trumpet." More than a month afterward, while still the
perturbations of the earth were continuing, this skeptic wrote
a poem upon the problem presented, voicing the sentiment:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My heart oppress'd demands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aid of the God who formed me with his hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sons of the God supreme to suffer all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fated alike, we on our Father call....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad is the present if no future state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No blissful retribution mortals wait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If fate's decrees the thinking being doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lose existence in the silent tomb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>All may be well</i>; that hope can man sustain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>All now is well</i>; 'tis an illusion vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sages held me forth delusive light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divine instructions only can be right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humbly I sigh, submissive suffer pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor more the ways of Providence arraign."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;"<i>Poem on the Destruction of Lisbon,</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Smollet's translation; Works, Vol. XXXIII, ed. 1761.</i><br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Just at the time, plans were under way for the opening
of a theater at Lausanne for the special performance of some
of Voltaire's rationalistic dramas. But the enterprise was
deferred. One writer says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The earthquake had made all men thoughtful. They mistrusted
their love of the drama, and filled the churches instead."&mdash;<i>Tallentyre,
"Life of Voltaire," p. 319.</i></p></div>

<p>So, in an age of rationalism and unbelief, men's thoughts
were turned toward God, and human helplessness and earth's
instability were recognized.</p>


<h4>Extent of the Lisbon Earthquake</h4>

<p>As to the extent of the earthquake, a writer of the period
shows that it was felt in Sweden and in Africa and in the
West Indies, adding:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The effects were distributed over very nearly four millions of
square English miles of the earth's surface, and greatly surpassed anything
of the kind ever recorded in history."&mdash;<i>"History and Philosophy
of Earthquakes" (London, 1757), p. 333.</i></p></div>

<p>The commander of an English ship, lying off Lisbon at
the time, thus described the scene in a letter to the ship's
owners:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Almost all the palaces and large churches were rent down, or part
fallen, and scarce one house of this vast city is left habitable. Everybody
that was not crushed to death ran out into the large places, and those
near the river ran down to save themselves by boats, or any other floating
convenience, running, crying, and calling to the ships for assistance; but
whilst the multitude were gathered near the riverside, the water rose to
such a height that it overflowed the lower part of the city, which so terrified
the miserable and already dismayed inhabitants, who ran to and fro
with dreadful cries, which we heard plainly on board, that it made them
believe the dissolution of the world was at hand; every one falling on his
knees and entreating the Almighty for His assistance.... By two o'clock
the ships' boats began to ply, and took multitudes on board.... The
fear, the sorrow, the cries and lamentations of the poor inhabitants are
unexpressible; every one begging pardon, and embracing each other, crying,
Forgive me, friend, brother, sister! Oh! what will become of us!
neither water nor land will protect us, and the third element, fire, seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
now to threaten our total destruction! as in effect it happened. The
conflagration
lasted a whole week."&mdash;<i>Thomas Hunter, "Historical Account
of Earthquakes" (Liverpool, 1756), pp. 72-74.</i></p></div>


<h4>Recognized as a Sign</h4>

<p>Looking down through the ages, the prophet of the Revelation
saw the coming of the latter days, when signs of the
approaching end were to begin to appear. Just there he beheld
"a great earthquake." The terrible event was noted by
inspiration as a sign of the coming of the final judgment.
Earthquakes there had been before, and increasing earthquakes
were to follow after,&mdash;"earthquakes in divers places,"&mdash;as
Christ foretold, speaking of the signs of His second coming.
But as befitted this first of the series of signs of the approaching
end, a conviction from God seemed to come into
the hearts of men in that generation, that this was indeed a
token to remind the world of a coming day of doom.</p>

<p>In the year of the disaster, an English poet, John Biddolf,
published a book of verse, pointing some of the lessons of the
hour, from which we quote a few descriptive stanzas:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Calm was the sky; the sun serenely bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot o'er the sea long dazzling streams of light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through orange groves soft breathing breezes play'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gathered sweets like bees where'er they stray'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fair relievo stood the lofty town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set off by radiant lights and shadows brown.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ill-fated city! there were revels kept;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devoid of fear, they ate, they drank, they slept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No friendly voice like that of ancient Rome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was sent to give them warning of their doom:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No airy warriors to each other clung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as 'tis said o'er destin'd Sion hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But like a nightly thief their dreadful fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unlooked for came and undermined their state....<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lo, what a sudden change! On ruin's brink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The proud turn humble, and the thoughtless think.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark, gloomy sadness overclouds the gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hypocrites for once sincerely pray....</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span><br />
<span class="i0">But let it not be thought their horrid deeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had pulled this dreadful judgment on their heads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or that for crimes too horrible to tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like guilty Sodom, thunderstruck they fell....<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who can with curious eyes this globe survey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not behold it tottering with decay?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things created, God's designs fulfil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And natural causes work His destined will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that eternal Word, which cannot lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mortals hath revealed in prophecy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in these latter days such signs should come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preludes and prologues to the general doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not the Son of man can tell that day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, lest it find you sleeping, watch and pray."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus this first of the predicted latter-day signs bore its
message to men. Its immediate scene was set in the Old
World, but its warning was world-wide. The next sign foretold
was to appear in the New World, but like the Lisbon
earthquake, its message of warning was for all men.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_DARK_DAY_OF_1780" id="THE_DARK_DAY_OF_1780"></a>THE DARK DAY OF 1780</h2>


<h4>"The Sun Shall be Darkened"</h4>

<p>We recall that in the vision of latter-day signs given to the
prophet John, he saw the "great earthquake" followed by
a sign in the heavens:</p>

<p>"The sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon
became as blood." Rev. 6:12.</p>

<p>Of this event our Saviour spoke, in giving the signs of His
second coming which were to begin to appear following the
cutting short of the days of persecution. We repeat His
words:</p>

<p>"Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the
sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light."
Matt. 24:29.</p>


<h4>The Prophecy Fulfilled</h4>

<p>True to the order of the prophecy, following the great
earthquake of 1755 in Europe, there came, in America, the
second sign of the approaching end, the wonderful darkening
of the sun, known in history as "The Dark Day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>This sign appeared at the time indicated in the prophecy,
"immediately after the tribulation of those days;" or as Mark
has it, "in those days, after that tribulation." On May 19,
1780, the sun was darkened, and the following night the moon
did not give her light. Whatever explanation men may have
to offer as to the cause of the phenomenon, the fact remains
that when the time of the prophecy came, the sign appeared.</p>

<p>The first volume of the "Memoirs of the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences," published in Boston in 1785,
contains a paper entitled, "An Account of a Very Uncommon
Darkness in the States of New England, May 19, 1780. By
Samuel Williams, A.M., Hollis Professor of Mathematics
and Philosophy in the University at Cambridge [Massachusetts]."</p>

<p>Of the extent, duration, and degree of darkness on that
occasion, this scientific observer said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The extent of this darkness was very remarkable.... From the
accounts that have been received, it seems to have extended all over the
New England States. It was observed as far east as Falmouth [Portland,
Maine]. To the westward, we hear of its reaching to the furthest
parts of Connecticut, and Albany. To the southward, it was observed
all along the seacoasts. And to the north as far as our settlements extend....</p>

<p>"With regard to its duration, it continued in this place at least fourteen
hours: but it is probable this was not exactly the same in different
parts of the country. The appearance and effects were such as tended
to make the prospect extremely dull and gloomy. Candles were lighted
up in the houses; the birds having sung their evening songs, disappeared,
and became silent; the fowls retired to roost; the cocks were crowing all
around as at break of day; objects could not be distinguished but at a
very little distance; and everything bore the appearance and gloom of
night." (See pages 234-246.)</p></div>

<p>Whittier has commemorated it in the poem, "Abraham
Davenport:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Twas on a May day of the far old year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seventeen hundred eighty, that there fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the bloom and sweet life of the spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the fresh earth and the heaven of noon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A horror of great darkness....<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Birds ceased to sing, and all the barnyard fowls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roosted; the cattle at the pasture bars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lowed, and looked homeward; bats on leathern wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flitted abroad; the sounds of labor died;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men prayed, and women wept; all ears grew sharp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear the doom blast of the trumpet shatter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The black sky."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The words of the poet are substantiated by the plain prose
of the dictionary maker. In the department explanatory of
"Noted Names," Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (edition
1883) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>The Dark Day</i>, May 19, 1780&mdash;so called on account of a remarkable
darkness on that day extending over all New England.... The obscuration
began about ten o'clock in the morning, and continued till the middle
of the next night, but with difference of degree and duration in different
places.... The true cause of this remarkable phenomenon is not known."</p></div>


<h4>Cause Unknown</h4>

<p>At the time, some explained the darkness as being due
to smoke from forest fires, others to the exceptional rise of
vapors and atmospheric dust in the warm spring following
the melting of unusually heavy winter snows. But forest
fires were not of extraordinary occurrence in these regions,
and many a springtime since has seen the melting of heavy
winter snows and the rise of vapors; yet May 19, 1780, still
stands unique in the annals of modern times as "the dark
day." However observers and writers disagreed as to the
nature of the mantle of darkness that was drawn over New
England that day, they were <i>one</i> in recognizing the extraordinary
character of the event.</p>

<p>The facts are fully covered by the statement in the dictionary,
"The true cause of this remarkable phenomenon is
not known."</p>

<p>What we do know is that the Saviour's prophecy declared,
"Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the
sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light."
And when the time for it came, the sign appeared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>


<h4>Contemporary Records</h4>

<p>Though the comparatively small-sized newspapers of the
day were crowded with news of the progress of the Revolutionary
War, then raging, no little space was given to reports and
discussions of this remarkable darkening of the sun.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the Boston <i>Gazette and Country Journal</i>
(of May 29, 1780) reported observations made at Ipswich
Hamlet, Mass., "by several gentlemen of liberal education:"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"About eleven o'clock the darkness was such as to demand our attention,
and put us upon making observations. At half past eleven, in
a room with three windows, twenty-four panes each, all open toward the
southeast and south, large print could not be read by persons of good eyes.</p>

<p>"About twelve o'clock, the windows being still open, a candle cast
a shade so well defined on the wall, as that profiles were taken with as
much ease as they could have been in the night.</p>

<p>"About one o'clock a glint of light which had continued to this time
in the east, shut in, and the darkness was greater than it had been for any
time before.... We dined about two, the windows all open, and two
candles burning on the table.</p>

<p>"In the time of the greatest darkness some of the ... fowls went
to their roost. Cocks crowed in answer to one another as they commonly
do in the night. Woodcocks, which are night birds, whistled as they do
<i>only</i> in the dark. Frogs peeped. In short, there was the appearance
of midnight at noonday.</p>

<p>"About three o'clock the light in the west increased, the motion of
the clouds [became] more quick, their color higher and more brassy than
at any time before. There appeared to be quick flashes or coruscations,
not unlike the aurora borealis.... About half past four our company,
which had passed an unexpected night very cheerfully together,
broke up."</p></div>

<p>Of the night following, this gentleman (then at Salem)
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Perhaps it never was darker since the children of Israel left the
house of bondage. This gross darkness held till about one o'clock, although
the moon had fulled but the day before."</p></div>

<p>The Boston <i>Independent Chronicle</i> of June 8 quoted from
Thomas's <i>Massachusetts Spy</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"During the whole time a sickly, melancholy gloom overcast the face
of nature. Nor was the darkness of the night less uncommon and terrifying
than that of the day; notwithstanding there was almost a full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
moon, no object was discernible, but by the help of some artificial light,
which when seen from the neighboring houses and other places at a distance,
appeared through a kind of Egyptian darkness, which seemed almost
impervious to the rays.</p>

<p>"This unusual phenomenon excited the fears and apprehensions of
many people. Some considered it as a portentous omen of the wrath of
Heaven in vengeance denounced against the land, others as the immediate
harbinger of the last day, when 'the sun shall be darkened, and the moon
shall not give her light.'"</p></div>

<p>Not only over the land, but out at sea also, the unnatural
darkness of the day and night of May 19, 1780, was observed.
In the <i>Independent Chronicle</i> of June 15, 1780, a correspondent,
telling of interviews with various observers, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I have also seen a very sensible captain of a vessel, who was that
morning about forty leagues southeast of Boston. He says the cloud
which appeared at the west was the blackest he ever saw. About eleven
o'clock there was a little rain, and it grew dark. Between one and two
he was obliged to light a large candle to steer by.... Between nine
and ten at night, he ordered his men to take in some of the sails, but it
was so dark that they could not find the way from one mast to the other."</p></div>


<h4>Thoughts Turned to the Judgment</h4>

<p>This writer commented as follows concerning the feelings
awakened by the event:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Various have been the sentiments of people concerning the designs
of Providence in spreading the unusual darkness over us. Some suppose
it portentous of the last scene. I wish it may have some good effect on
the minds of the wicked, and that they may be excited to prepare for that
solemn day."</p></div>

<p>The <i>Independent Chronicle</i> of June 22, 1780, printed a
letter from Dr. Samuel Stearns, who had been appealed to
because of his knowledge "in philosophy and astronomy."
First, he disposed of one suggestion that had been made:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That the darkness was not caused by an eclipse is manifest by the
various positions of the planets of our system at that time; for the moon
was more than one hundred and fifty degrees from the sun all that day."</p></div>

<p>Then, in the rather heavy language of the science of that
period, this writer told how the action of the sun's heat was
continually projecting into the atmosphere particles of earthy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
matter; and in his opinion it was some "vast collection of
such particles that caused the late uncommon darkness."
But as to the real accounting for the phenomenon he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The primary cause must be imputed to Him that walketh through
the circuit of heaven, who stretcheth out the heaven like a curtain, who
maketh the clouds His chariot, who walketh upon the wings of the wind.
It was He, at whose voice the stormy winds are obedient, that commanded
these exhalations to be collected and condensed together, that
with them He might darken both the day and the night; which darkness
was, perhaps, not only a token of His indignation against the crying
iniquities and abominations of the people, but an omen of some future
destruction."</p></div>

<p>Thus men's minds were exercised by this sign "in the sun,
and in the moon."</p>

<p>The early records of New York City tell of the interest
excited there, though evidently the darkness was not so marked
as it was farther north.</p>


<h4>In the Connecticut Legislature</h4>

<p>President Timothy Dwight, of Yale College, a contemporary,
left the following account of one of the historic incidents
of the day:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The legislature of Connecticut was then in session at Hartford. A
very general opinion prevailed that the day of judgment was at hand.
The house of representatives, being unable to transact their business,
adjourned. A proposal to adjourn the council [a second legislative body
called the Governor's Council] was under consideration. When the opinion
of Colonel Davenport was asked, he answered, 'I am against an
adjournment. The day of judgment is either approaching or it is not.
If it is not, there is no cause for an adjournment; if it is, I choose to be
found doing my duty. I wish therefore that candles may be brought.'"&mdash;<i>Barber,
"Connecticut Historical Collections," p. 403.</i></p></div>

<p>It was this striking incident that Whittier described with
the poet's pen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Meanwhile in the old Statehouse, dim as ghosts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat the lawgivers of Connecticut,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembling beneath their legislative robes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'It is the Lord's great day! Let us adjourn,'<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Some said; and then, as with one accord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All eyes were turned to Abraham Davenport.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rose, slow cleaving with his steady voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The intolerable hush. 'This well may be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day of judgment which the world awaits;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But be it so or not, I only know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My present duty, and my Lord's command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To occupy till He come. So at the post<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where He hath set me in His providence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I choose, for one, to meet Him face to face,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No faithless servant, frightened from my task,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ready when the Lord of the harvest calls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore, with all reverence, I would say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let God do His work, we will see to ours.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring in the candles.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus, in a manner that arrested the attention of men and
put awe and solemnity into their hearts, with thoughts of
the coming of the great day of God, the first of the predicted
signs in the heavens was revealed.</p>

<p>At a later time, when students of the Bible seemed
moved upon simultaneously, in both Europe and America,
to give attention to the doctrine of Christ's second coming,
it was more generally understood that these signs had come
in fulfilment of prophecy.</p>

<p>As we look to the past, we see how truly the tokens of the
coming King began to appear as the church of Christ emerged
fully from the long, dark period of tribulation. A new era
was dawning, in which the Lord was to fill the earth with light
before His second appearing, according to His word to Daniel
the prophet:</p>

<p>"Thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book,
even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and
knowledge shall be increased." Dan. 12:4.</p>

<p>At last the time of the end was at hand, and the signs of
the latter days had begun to appear in the earth and in the
heavens. The Lord was preparing to send to all the world
the closing gospel message of Christ's soon coming in glory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_FALLING_STARS_OF_1833" id="THE_FALLING_STARS_OF_1833"></a>THE FALLING STARS OF 1833</h2>


<h4>"The Stars Shall Fall from Heaven"</h4>

<p>A great impetus was given to the study of divine prophecy
by the events of the closing years of the eighteenth century.
Observers had seen the papal power receive a "deadly wound"
in the events and effects of the French Revolution; and it was
understood that the world was entering a new era of enlightenment
and liberty.</p>

<p>Bible students began to see more clearly the lesson of the
great outlines of historic prophecy, and hearts were stirred
with the evidences that the coming of the Lord was drawing
near. In Europe and America, in the early decades of the
nineteenth century, there was the beginning of a revival of
the study and preaching of the advent idea.</p>


<h4>Another Sign in the Heavens</h4>

<p>Just here appeared another great sign in the heavens,
foretold by the word of prophecy. Of the sign that was to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
follow the darkening of the sun and moon, Christ's prophecy
says:</p>

<p>"The stars shall fall from heaven." Matt. 24:29.</p>

<p>The prophet John beheld the spectacle in a vision of the
last days, and described it in these words:</p>

<p>"The stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree
casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty
wind." Rev. 6:13.</p>

<p>On Nov. 13, 1833, came the wondrous celestial exhibition
of falling stars, which is listed as one of the most remarkable
phenomena of the astronomical story.</p>

<p>Meteoric displays, swarms of shooting stars, have been
observed at various times all through the ages; but this phenomenon,
coming in the order given by the prophecy, that is,
following the darkening of the sun, constituted the sublime
display answering to the pen-picture of the Apocalypse,&mdash;as
if all the stars of heaven were falling to the earth.</p>

<p>The essential thing about a sign is that it shall be seen,
that the circumstances of its appearance shall fasten attention.
Not in America alone, but equally in all the civilized world,
as a topic of study, this sign in the heavens commanded the
attention of men.</p>

<p>An English scientist, Rev. Thomas Milner, F.R.G.S.,
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The attention of astronomers in Europe, and all over the world,
was, as may be imagined, strongly roused by intelligence of this celestial
display on the Western continent."&mdash;<i>"The Gallery of Nature" (London,
1852), p. 141.</i></p></div>

<p>This writer called it "by far the most splendid display on
record."&mdash;<i>Id., p. 139.</i></p>

<p>Another English astronomical writer of more recent date
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Once for all, then, as the result of the star fall of 1833, the study of
luminous meteors became an integral part of astronomy."&mdash;<i>Clerke,
"History of Astronomy in the Nineteenth Century," p. 329.</i></p></div>

<p>This same work describes the extent of the display as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On the night of Nov. 12-13, 1833, a tempest of falling stars broke
over the earth. North America bore the brunt of its pelting. From the
Gulf of Mexico to Halifax, until daylight with some difficulty put an end
to the display, the sky was scored in every direction with shining tracks
and illuminated with majestic fireballs."&mdash;<i>Page 328.</i></p></div>


<h4>The Spectacle Described</h4>

<p>The closest scientific observations were made by Prof.
Denison Olmsted, professor of astronomy at Yale, who wrote
in the <i>American Journal of Science</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The morning of Nov. 13, 1833, was rendered memorable by an
exhibition of the phenomenon called shooting stars, which was probably
more extensive and magnificent than any similar one hitherto recorded....
Probably no celestial phenomenon has ever occurred in this country,
since its first settlement, which was viewed with so much admiration and
delight by one class of spectators, or with so much astonishment and fear
by another class. For some time after the occurrence, the 'meteoric
phenomenon' was the principal topic of conversation in every circle."&mdash;<i>Volume
XXV (1834), pp. 363, 364.</i></p></div>

<p>Prof. Simon Newcomb, the astronomer, declares this
phenomenal exhibition of falling stars "the most remarkable
one ever observed." (See "Astronomy for Everybody,"
p. 280.)</p>

<p>This was not merely a display of an unusual number of
falling stars, such as Humboldt observed in South America
in 1799, or such as we find recorded of other times before and
since. It was a "shower" of falling stars, just such a spectacle
as one must picture from the words of the prophecy, "And
the stars of heaven fell."</p>

<p>The French astronomer Flammarion says of the density
of the shower:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Boston observer, Olmsted, compared them, at the moment
of maximum, to half the number of flakes which we perceive in the air
during an ordinary shower of snow."&mdash;<i>"Popular Astronomy," p. 536.</i></p></div>

<p>This affords us a better idea of the scene than the estimate
of 34,640 stars an hour, which was made by Professor Olmsted
after the rain of the stars had greatly abated, so that he was
able to make an attempt at counting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Humphreys, president of St. John's College, Annapolis,
said of the appearance at the Maryland capital:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the words of most, they fell <i>like flakes of snow</i>."&mdash;<i>American
Journal of Science, Vol. XXV (1834), p. 372.</i></p></div>

<p>Nothing less than this could have presented the counterpart
of the prophetic picture.</p>

<p>Thoughtful hearts were solemnized by the unwonted spectacle.
Prof. Alexander Twining, civil engineer, "late tutor in
Yale College," giving his views as to the nature of the flaming
visitants from space, wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Had they held on their course unabated for three seconds longer,
half a continent must, to all appearance, have been involved in unheard-of
calamity. But that almighty Being who made the world, and knew
its dangers, gave it also its armature&mdash;endowing the atmospheric medium
around it with protecting, no less than with life-sustaining, properties....</p>

<p>"Considered as one of the rare and wonderful displays of the Creator's
preserving care, as well as the terrible magnitude and power of His
agencies, it is not meet that such occurrences as those of November 13
should leave no more solid and permanent effect upon the human mind
than the impression of a splendid scene."&mdash;<i>American Journal of Science,
Vol. XXVI (1834), p. 351.</i></p></div>

<p>Multitudes felt that the great Creator had spoken to men
in this notable wonder of His heavens. Again and again in
the records and reminiscences of that time, testimony is borne
to the fact that observers were impressed with the likeness
of the scene to that described in the divine prophecy as one of
the signs of the end of the world.</p>


<h4>The Prophetic Picture Reproduced</h4>

<p>The New York <i>Journal of Commerce</i> emphasized the exactness
of detail with which the prophecy described the scene as
it appeared in 1833. This is the apocalyptic picture, as the
ancient prophet saw it in vision:</p>

<p>"The stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree
casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty
wind." Rev. 6:13.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>A correspondent of the <i>Journal of Commerce</i> draws the
picture as it was seen nearly eighteen centuries later, the likeness
to the prophetic description being emphasized in every
line:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"No philosopher or scholar has told or recorded an event like that
of yesterday morning. A prophet eighteen hundred years ago foretold
it exactly, if we will be at the trouble of understanding stars falling to
mean falling stars."&mdash;<i>New York Journal of Commerce, Nov. 14, 1833.</i></p></div>

<p>In this connection was noted by the same writer the special
appropriateness of the prophet's figure of the fig tree casting
the green figs in a mighty wind:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Here is the exactness of the prophet. The falling stars did not
come as if from <i>several</i> trees shaken, but from <i>one</i>. Those which
appeared
in the east fell toward the east: those which appeared in the north fell
toward the north; those which appeared in the west fell toward the west;
and those which appeared in the south (for I went out of my residence
into the park) fell toward the south; and they fell not as ripe fruit falls;
far from it; but they <i>flew</i>, they were <i>cast</i>, like the unripe fig,
which at first
refuses to leave the branch; and when it does break its hold, flies swiftly,
straight off, descending; and in the multitude falling, some cross the track
of others, as they are thrown with more or less force."</p></div>

<p>Professor Olmsted's long and carefully elaborated account
in the <i>American Journal of Science</i>, gave a report from
a correspondent in Bowling Green, Mo., as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Though there was no moon, when we first observed them; their
brilliancy was so great that we could, at times, read common-sized print
without much difficulty, and the light which they afforded was much
whiter than that of the moon, in the clearest and coldest night, when the
ground is covered with snow. The air itself, the face of the earth as far
as we could behold it, all the surrounding objects, and the very countenances
of men, wore the aspect and hue of death, occasioned by the continued,
pallid glare of these countless meteors, which in all their grandeur
flamed 'lawless through the sky.'</p>

<p>"There was a grand and indescribable gloom on all around, an awe-inspiring
sublimity on all above; while&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'The sanguine flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolled a broad slaughter o'er the plains of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nature's self did seem to totter on the brink of time!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>" ... There was scarcely a space in the firmament which was not
filled at every instant with these falling stars, nor on it could you in general
perceive any particular difference in appearance; still at times they
seemed to shower down in groups&mdash;calling to mind the fig tree, casting
her untimely figs when shaken by a mighty wind."&mdash;<i>Volume XXV (1834),
p. 382.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 301px;">
<img src="images/p098.jpg" width="301" height="448" alt="THE SIGN OF FIRE

&quot;As this sign of fire in the watchtower was a signal to God&#39;s
people anciently to flee from the coming danger (see Jer.

earth are God&#39;s signals of warning to the people of our day.&quot;" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE SIGN OF FIRE<br />

&quot;As this sign of fire in the watchtower was a signal to God&#39;s
people anciently to flee from the coming danger (see Jer.
6:1), so the signs appearing now in the heavens and in the
earth are God&#39;s signals of warning to the people of our day.&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>


<h4>A Sign to All the World</h4>

<p>It was not in North America alone, but in all the civilized
world, that the attention of men was called to the prophetic
word by the discussions of this event. Thus the English
scientific writer, Thomas Milner, writing for the British public,
spoke as follows of the profound impression made:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In many districts, the mass of the population were terror-struck, and
the more enlightened were awed at contemplating so vivid a picture of
the apocalyptic image&mdash;that of the stars of heaven falling to the earth,
even as a fig tree casting her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty
wind."&mdash;<i>"The Gallery of Nature" (London, 1852), p. 140.</i></p></div>

<p>So the sign in the heavens made its solemn appeal to all
the world. It brought to the multitudes who saw it, thoughts
of God and the last great day. An observer living at the time
in Georgia, wrote, "Everybody felt that it was the judgment,
and that the end of the world had come." Another, in Kentucky,
wrote, "In every direction I could hear men, women,
and children screaming, 'The judgment day is come!'"</p>

<p>Rather, it was a signal that the hour of God's judgment
was drawing near. The signs so long foretold were appearing,
one by one, to register their enduring mark on the record
of fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p>Immediately following these times, there began an awakening
concerning the vital Bible doctrine of the second coming
of Christ, which has grown into the definite advent movement
that is carrying the gospel message of preparation for the coming
of the Lord to every nation and tongue and people.</p>


<h4>The Sign of 1833 Emphasized by Other Displays</h4>

<p>We have mentioned the fact that Humboldt had observed
an extraordinary fall of meteorites in South America, thirty-three
years, before, in 1799. And he reported at the time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
that the oldest inhabitants there had a recollection of a similar
display in 1766.</p>

<p>From these reports, scientists deduced the theory that
these showers were to be expected every thirty-three years.
Hence in 1866 they were watching for a repetition of the 1833
display.</p>

<p>That there was a measure of truth in the deduction was
made evident by an unusual fall of meteorites Nov. 14, 1866.
This time Europe was the scene of the display. But the event
was not to be compared with that of 1833. This appears
plain from the account of observations made by Sir Robert
Ball and Lord Rosse, the British astronomers.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Ball says that when the meteorites began to
fall, he and Lord Rosse went out upon the wall of the observatory
housing Lord Rosse's great reflecting telescope:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There, for the next two or three hours, we witnessed a spectacle
which can never fade from my memory. The shooting stars gradually
increased in number until sometimes several were seen at once."&mdash;<i>"Story
of the Heavens," p. 380.</i></p></div>

<p>Grand as the spectacle was, it was but a reminder, apparently,
of the star shower of 1833, when not "several" meteorites
fell at a time, nor many, merely, but, as it appeared,
"the stars of heaven fell unto the earth."</p>

<p>However, the spectacle of 1866, which was observed over
a great part of the Old World,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> served to direct renewed attention
to the incomparable event of 1833, as well as to the
prophetic descriptions of the "wonders in the heavens" (Joel
2:30) which were to appear as the end drew near.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 443px;">
<img src="images/p101.jpg" width="443" height="290" alt="CHRIST&#39;S PROMISE TO RETURN

&quot;I will come again, and receive you
unto Myself.&quot; John 14:3." title="" />
<span class="caption">CHRIST&#39;S PROMISE TO RETURN<br />

&quot;I will come again, and receive you
unto Myself.&quot; John 14:3.</span>
</div>

<p>Textbooks and astronomical works thereupon began to
count it as fully established that every thirty-three years the
displays would be repeated. It was confidently predicted
that 1899 would witness a repetition, possibly on the scale
of 1833.</p>

<p>Professor Langley's "New Astronomy" (published in 1888)
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The great November shower, which is coming once more in this
century, and which every reader may hope to see toward 1899, is of particular
interest to us as the first whose movements were subject to analysis."</p></div>

<p>Chambers's Astronomy, published in 1889, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The meteors of November 13 may be expected to reappear with
great brilliancy in 1899."&mdash;-<i>Volume I, p. 635.</i></p></div>

<p>But the November date passed in 1899, and the years
have passed; and the wondrous scene of 1833 has not been
repeated. Clerke's "History of Astronomy in the Nineteenth
Century" says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We can no longer count upon the Leonids [as the meteorites of 1833
were called, because they seemed to fall from a point in the constellation of
Leo]. Their glory, for scenic purposes, is departed."&mdash;<i>Page 338.</i></p></div>


<h4>The Lord's Signal to Watch</h4>

<p>Thus the wisest astronomical predictions made shortly
before 1899, based upon the apparently recurrent regularity
of the phenomenon, failed; but the predictions of the sure
word of prophecy, set down on the sacred record eighteen
centuries before, were fulfilled to the letter.</p>

<p>At the close of the days of the predicted tribulation of
the church, the signs began to appear&mdash;the sun was darkened,
the moon withheld its light, and the stars of heaven fell.</p>

<p>The series began at the time specified, the signs came in
the order given in Christ's prophecy. The record of history
bears witness that the prophecy was fulfilled.</p>

<p>It may be that on a yet more awful and universal scale
these phenomena will be seen again in that last shaking of
the powers of heaven which is to attend the rolling back of
the heavens as a scroll, the immediate prelude to Christ's
glorious appearing. But Christ's prophecy, at this point, was
not giving a description of events at the very end of the
world, but signs by which it might be known when the end
was drawing near.</p>

<p>As the signs should be recognized, the Saviour intended
that those who loved His appearing should be quickened with
hope, and inspired to hasten to the world with the gospel
message preparing the way of the Lord. The Lord's word
for His children was,</p>

<p>"When these things begin to come to pass, then look up,
and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh."
Luke 21:28.</p>

<p>Long ago these signs began to come to pass. Now may
the Lord's believing children well look up and rejoice, knowing
that the day of eternal redemption is indeed nigh at hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

The display was most brilliant, apparently, in Western Asia. The veteran
missionary, Dr. H.H. Jessup, of the Presbyterian Missionary College, of
Beirut, describes the scene in his "Fifty-Three Years in Syria:" "On the
morning of the fourteenth [November], at three o'clock, I was roused from a
deep sleep by the voice of one of the young men calling, 'The stars are all
coming down.' ... The meteors poured down like a rain of fire. Many of
them were large and varicolored, and left behind them a long train of fire.
One immense green meteor came down over Lebanon, seeming as large as the
moon, and exploded with a large noise, leaving a green pillar of light in its
train. It was vain to attempt to count them, and the display continued until
dawn, when their light was obscured by the king of day.... The Mohammedans
gave the call to prayer from the minarets, and the common people
were in terror."&mdash;<i>Volume I, pp. 316, 317.</i></p></div>

<h2>THE MEANING OF PRESENT-DAY CONDITIONS</h2>

<h3>"THERE SHALL BE SIGNS ... UPON THE EARTH"</h3>


<p>From the specific signs in the heavens, which were to
herald the coming of the latter days and awaken the church
to look for its coming Lord, our Saviour's prophecy passed
on to designate certain general conditions in the world which
were to continue until the great day of God comes:</p>

<p>"There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in
the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity;
the sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing
them for fear, and for looking after those things which are
coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud
with power and great glory." Luke 21:25-27.</p>

<p>Among the developments here foretold, and which contribute
to the "distress of nations, with perplexity," we may
list the following:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 444px;">

<span class="caption">THE ARMING OF THE NATIONS<br />

&quot;Prepare war,... beat your plowshares

</div>


<h4>1. Political Unrest&mdash;the Arming of the Nations</h4>

<p>Following on closely with the signs in the heavens, there
appears also the awakening to national aspirations and rivalries
in Europe, out of which has grown the arming of the nations.
The beginning of the modern race of armaments may
be dated from those stirring and eventful years of 1830 to
1848. We have seen the resources of the soil and the inventive
genius of man devoted to preparations for war on a scale
never before thought of. The prophet Joel foretold these
conditions in the last days:</p>

<p>"Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles ["the nations,"
R.V.]: Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men
of war draw near; let them come up: beat your plowshares
into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears: let the weak
say, I am strong.... Let the heathen be wakened....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision [or "cutting
off"]: for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision."
Joel 3: 9-14.</p>

<p>Another prophecy forewarns of the "peace and safety"
cry that is to be heard as the end draws near. We are told
that many people in the last days will be saying that swords
are to be beaten into plowshares, and that the nations will
cease from war (Isa. 2:3, 4); but the actual conditions are
repeatedly described in prophecy as warlike and perilous.
Thus the revelator saw the closing days:</p>

<p>"The nations were angry, and Thy wrath is come, and
the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that
Thou shouldst give reward unto Thy servants the prophets,
and to the saints, and them that fear Thy name, small and
great; and shouldst destroy them which destroy the earth."
Rev. 11: 18.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>What we see then among the nations proclaims the approaching
end.</p>


<h4>2. Signs in the Social World</h4>

<p>A New Testament prophecy of the latter days says:</p>

<p>"In the last days perilous times shall come. For men
shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without
natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent,
fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady,
high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God."
2 Tim. 3: 1-4.</p>

<p>The "perilous times" have come, when, as never before,
the world is pleasure mad.</p>

<p>"Unrestrained passion for pleasure," said M. Comte,
editor of the French <i>Rel&egrave;vement Social</i>, writing just before the
European war, is bringing a terrible train of evils into modern
society. Along with it he put "the hunt for money without
regard for means," adding:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This is the theme which manufacturers, business men, men in the
public administration, continually harp on with ever the same conviction
and ever the same wealth of proof.</p>

<p>"The note is ever the same, and the conclusion identical: <i>Nous sommes
perdus!</i> [We are lost!]"&mdash;<i>Quoted in Record of Christian Work, July,
1914.</i></p></div>

<p>Many agencies for social and temperance reform are rendering
the greatest human service; but for lost humanity the
only hope is Christ, the divine Saviour. With an urgency
born of the last call, His gospel is sounding to a world on the
verge of eternity. Yet with divine love longing to save, the
world sweeps on, less and less mindful of eternal interests.
Christ's prophecy foretold it as it is:</p>

<p>"As the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the
Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood
they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage,
until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and knew
not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall
also the coming of the Son of man be." Matt. 24: 37-39.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>Who can look out upon mankind today without the conviction
that this scripture is being fulfilled? The drift is strong
toward the world and away from God; but we are bidden
to watch and pray, lest the coming day find us unprepared.</p>


<h4>3. Signs in the Industrial World</h4>

<p>Industrial conditions today add their contribution to the
"distress of nations, with perplexity." Through the word
of prophecy the Lord long ago foretold these conditions, with
a warning to the careless rich, and a warning to the laborer
and the poor, not to be drawn into contention over the things
of this world, for the Judge is at the door. The prophecy,
it will be seen, refers specifically to latter-day conditions.</p>

</div>

<p>"Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries
that shall come upon you. Your riches are corrupted, and
your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and silver is cankered;
and the rust of them shall be a witness against you,
and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure
together for the last days. Behold, the hire of the laborers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept
back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have
reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. Ye
have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton;
ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. Ye
have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.</p>

<span class="caption">THE RICH YOUNG MAN<br />

&quot;Sell that thou hast, and give to the poor,
and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.&quot;

</div>

<p>"Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the
Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious
fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive
the early and latter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish
your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh. Grudge
not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned:
behold, the Judge standeth before the door." James 5: 1-9.</p>

<p>There is no need to argue that the issues with which the
prophecy deals are pressing upon the world with ever-increasing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
perplexity. We quote but two statements, by men not
engaged in agitation, but calmly and thoughtfully setting
down the signs of the times.</p>

<p>The late Lord Avebury (Sir John Lubbock) wrote a few
years ago in the <i>Review of Internationalism</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The religion of Europe is not Christianity, but the worship of the god
of war.... Unless something is done, the condition of the poor in Europe
will grow worse and worse. It is no use shutting our eyes. Revolution
may not come soon, not probably in our time, but come it will, and as
sure as fate there will be an explosion such as the world has never seen."</p></div>

<p>Of the rapid growth of discontent and its propaganda,
Mr. Frederick Townsend Martin, of New York, wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Fifty years ago there was scarcely a voice of protest; indeed, there
was hardly anything to protest against. Twenty-five years ago the protest
was clear and distinct, and we understood it. Ten years ago the
protest found expression in a dozen weekly publications, but today the
protest is circulated not by hundreds or thousands of printed copies of
books, pamphlets, magazines, and newspapers, but actually by the million.</p>

<p>"This propaganda of protest has its daily papers that are distinctive
and published for that purpose, and that purpose only. It has
its magazines and tens of thousands of weekly papers. Only a fool sneers
at such a volume of publicity as that....</p>

<p>"The warnings that hundreds of us are uttering may be ignored.
The squandering may go on, the vulgar bacchanalia may be prolonged,
the poor may have to writhe under the iron heel of the iron lord&mdash;the
dance of death may go on until society's E string snaps, and then the
Vesuvius of the underworld will belch forth its lava of death and
destruction."&mdash;<i>Hearst's Magazine, September, 1913.</i></p></div>

<p>Thus hearts grow faint "for looking after those things
which are coming on the earth." But while the increasing
"distress of nations, with perplexity," abounds, the Lord sends
the steadying, assuring message that soon Christ will come
to end the reign of sin and strife. He would have His children
keep the gospel light glowing, and wait patiently for Him.</p>


<h4>4. The Great Missionary Movement</h4>

<p>The Saviour's prophecy of the signs of His second coming
places the work of world evangelization as the culminating
sign. This in itself is a joyful token of the approaching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
end, a bright signal of hope in a suffering world. He said:</p>

<p>"This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end
come." Matt. 24: 14.</p>

<p>Before the end, the light of the gospel was to shine into
every dark corner of the earth. True to the sure word of
prophecy, when the latter days began,&mdash;"the time of the end,"&mdash;there
sprang up the great movement of modern missions
which has been one of the leading characteristics of the last
century. Here are a few facts showing the missionary developments
of a single century:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In 1800 the foreign missionary societies numbered seven. In 1900
they numbered over 500.</p>

<p>"In 1800 the income of seven societies amounted to about $50,000.
In 1900 the income was over $15,000,000.</p>

<p>"In 1800 the number of native communicants enrolled in Protestant
mission churches was 7,000. In 1900 there were 1,500,000 native communicants.</p>

<p>"In 1800 the adherents of Protestant churches in heathen lands were
estimated at 15,000. In 1900 they numbered 3,500,000.</p>

<p>"In 1800 only one fifth of the human family had the Bible in languages
they could read. In 1900 nine tenths of the people of the world
had the Word of God in languages and dialects known to them."</p></div>

<p>Since 1900 the missionary movement has remarkably increased
in extent and activity. It is estimated that now there
are about 22,000 foreign missionaries in the fields, with many
thousands of trained native evangelists and helpers.</p>

<p>The prophecy is fulfilling before our eyes. It is not the
conversion of the world that Christ's words foretold, but the
evangelization of the world; and when all the world has heard
the gospel of the kingdom, "then shall the end come."</p>

<p>Another prophecy&mdash;that of Rev. 14: 6-14&mdash;shows that
the closing phase of this world-wide missionary movement is
to be the proclamation of the special gospel message of preparation
for the coming of the Lord, calling all men to worship
God and keep His commandments, and warning them
against following the traditions of men that make void the
Word of God.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>With the coming of this generation there has come just
such a message, in the rise and progress of the advent movement,
the burden of the message being expressed in the very
language of the prophecy&mdash;"Fear God, and give glory to
Him; for the hour of His judgment is come." Rev. 14: 7.
And the movement is spreading rapidly "to every nation,
and kindred, and tongue, and people." Thus in vision the
prophet on Patmes heard the message given; and when its
warning cry had reached all nations, he saw Christ coming
in the clouds of heaven to reap the harvest of the earth.</p>


<h4>"Even at the Doors"</h4>

<p>Of the beginning of the special signs of the last days, Christ
said:</p>

<p>"When these things begin to come to pass, then look up,
and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh."
Luke 21: 28.</p>

<p>But of the time when these signs should all be seen fulfilled
or in process of fulfilment, the Saviour said:</p>

<p>"Now learn a parable of the fig tree: When his branch is
yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer
is nigh: so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things,
know that it is near, even at the doors. Verily I say unto
you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be
fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words
shall not pass away." Matt. 24: 32-35.</p>

<p>In this generation we see these things. All about us the
signs have appeared. We know, then, by the word that shall
not pass away, that the generation has at last appeared that
is to see the Saviour coming in power and great glory. "Of
that day and hour knoweth no man," but we may know "that
it is near, even at the doors"&mdash;the day for which the saints
of God have hoped through all the ages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_HISTORIC_PROPHECY_OF_DANIEL_7" id="THE_HISTORIC_PROPHECY_OF_DANIEL_7"></a>THE HISTORIC PROPHECY OF DANIEL 7</h2>

<h3>FOUR GREAT UNIVERSAL EMPIRES</h3>


<h4>Part I</h4>

<p>So important is it that we understand the events leading
on to the end, that repeatedly the "sure word of prophecy"
outlines the course of this world's history, and sets up waymarks
along the highway to the everlasting kingdom.</p>

<p>In the light of prophecy we see the hand of God guiding
and overruling through all history, shaping events for the
carrying out of His purpose to end the reign of sin and to bring
in the reign of eternal righteousness. His prophetic word
foretells events of history, that we may know that He is the
living God over all, and that we may understand that the divine
purpose will surely be fulfilled. Above a wicked world
there is a God in heaven, waiting only the appointed time
for the accomplishment of His purposes.</p>

<p>"I am God, and there is none like Me, declaring the end
from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will
do all My pleasure.... I have spoken it, I also will bring
it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.... My salvation
shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion."
Isa. 46:9-13.</p>

<p>In the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, recorded in the second
chapter of Daniel, the Lord revealed in brief but graphic
outline the course of history from the days of Babylon to the
end of the world. The four great universal monarchies,&mdash;Babylon,
Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome&mdash;were represented
by the various parts of the metallic image. That prophecy
described particularly the division of the Roman Empire into
the kingdoms of western Europe. "In the days of these
kings," declared the word of the Lord, the God of heaven was
to set up His kingdom, bringing an end to all earthly powers.</p>

<p>In the seventh chapter we are taken over the same course
of history, in Daniel's vision of the four beasts. Here also
chief attention is devoted to the fourth great kingdom; and
especially to its divided state; for the events taking place at
this time are of the deepest eternal interest to all men.</p>

<p>In this vision Daniel saw four universal empires represented
by great beasts. One after another the symbolic
beasts arose, did their work, and gave place to the next scenes
in the history. The angel clearly explained to Daniel the
meaning of the vision:</p>

<p>"These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which
shall arise out of the earth. But the saints of the Most High
shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever,
even forever and ever."</p>

<p>Of necessity, then, it is a repetition of the story of the four
universal monarchies dealt with in the second chapter, and
ending with the setting up of the everlasting kingdom.</p>

<p>Let us place the view given the prophet in vision alongside
the record of history.</p>

<p>First, however, a word as to the manner in which the great
beasts appeared to the prophet:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds
of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great
beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another."</p>

<p>Again and again, in the figurative language of Scripture,
winds are used as the symbol for wars; and the sea, or waters,
for nations or peoples. (See Jer. 25:31-33; Rev. 17:15.) The
prophet saw the clashing of the nations in war, and out of
these conflicts arose the kingdoms described in the prophecy.</p>

</div>


<h4>Babylon</h4>

<p>Note the prophetic picture of the prophecy and the corresponding
representation in history.</p>

<p><i>Prophecy.</i>&mdash;"The first was like a lion, and had eagle's
wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it
was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as
a man, and a man's heart was given to it."</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;As the lion is king of beasts, it was a fitting
symbol of Babylon, "the glory of kingdoms." Isa. 13:19.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
The eagle's wings suggest rapidity of movement and far-reaching
conquest. The prophet Habakkuk said of it, "Their
horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle."
This was the characteristic of Babylon under the earlier kings,
but especially under Nebuchadnezzar. Berosus, the ancient
Chaldean historian, wrote of him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This Babylonian king conquered Egypt, and Syria, and Phenicia,
and Arabia; and exceeded in his exploits all that had reigned before him
in Babylon." (See Flavius Josephus "Against Apion," book 1, par. 19.)</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 443px;">
<img src="images/p120.jpg" width="443" height="278" alt="THE SECOND BEAST

&quot;And behold another beast, a second,
like to a bear.&quot; Dan. 7:5." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE SECOND BEAST<br />

&quot;And behold another beast, a second,
like to a bear.&quot; Dan. 7:5.</span>
</div>

<p>But now, at the time of Daniel's vision, degeneracy had
come; the empire was tottering. The lion heart was gone,
the eagle's wings were plucked, and within three years from
the time the vision was given, Babylon was overthrown.</p>


<h4>Medo-Persia</h4>

<p>As the dominion passed from Babylon to the next great
power, the prophet says:</p>

<p><i>Prophecy.</i>&mdash;"Behold another beast, a second, like to a bear,
and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto
it, Arise, devour much flesh."</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The Medes and Persians overthrew Babylon.
Medo-Persia was a dual kingdom, lifting itself up on one side,
first the Median branch the stronger, then the Persian, under
Cyrus and his successors, rising higher. This two-sided characteristic,
noted as a distinguishing mark in the prophecy,
was emphasized by the ancient writers also. &AElig;schylus, the
Greek poet, who lived in the time of Persia, wrote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Asia's brave host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Mede first led. The virtues of his son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed firm the empire....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">... Cyrus third, by fortune graced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adorned the throne."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;"<i>Pers&#339;.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The word spoken in the vision, "Arise, devour much flesh,"
describes the history from the time when the Persian side
rose uppermost. Rawlinson says, "Cyrus proceeded with
scarcely a pause on a long career of conquest."</p>

<p>An alliance against Persia was formed by Lydia, Egypt,
and Babylon (Herodotus 1:77); and as these three great
provinces were subdued, they may well be represented by
the three ribs in the mouth of the Medo-Persian bear.</p>


<h4>Grecia</h4>

<p>Yet another kingdom was to follow, and strikingly the
symbol pictures the characteristics of the Greek conquest.</p>

<p><i>Prophecy.</i>&mdash;"After this I beheld, and lo another, like a
leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl;
and the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given
to it."</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The third kingdom was Grecia. Under Alexander
the Great, the Greeks swept into Asia with the quickness
of the leopard's spring. And the four wings on the leopard
must represent astonishing fleetness. Plutarch speaks of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the "incredible swiftness" of Alexander's conquests. Appian
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The empire of Alexander was splendid in its magnitude, in its
armies, in the success and rapidity of its conquests, and it wanted little
of being boundless and unexampled, yet in its shortness of duration it
was like a brilliant flash of lightning. Although broken into several
satrapies, even the parts were splendid."&mdash;<i>"History of Rome," preface,
par. 10.</i></p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 442px;">
<img src="images/p122.jpg" width="442" height="275" alt="THE THIRD BEAST

<span class="caption">THE THIRD BEAST<br />

&quot;After this I beheld, and lo another,
like a leopard.&quot; Dan. 7:6.</span>
</div>

<p>Thus the ancient Roman writer pictured the career of
Grecia just as represented by the prophetic symbol&mdash;the
fleetness, the great dominion given it, the division of the empire
into satrapies, as suggested by the four heads of the leopard.
Out of the conflicts following Alexander's death, there
came the fourfold headship of the empire. Rawlinson says,
"A quadripartite division of Alexander's domain was recognized."
(See "Sixth Monarchy," chap. 3.) The real situation
is best represented, as Dr. Albert Barnes says, by "one
animal with four heads," just as the prophetic symbol described
it centuries before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the course of empire followed the outline of the
"sure word of prophecy" from age to age.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Armies were ranged in battle's dread array:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They perished&mdash;with them ceased their tyrants' sway;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New wars, new heroes came&mdash;their story passed away."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was to be no abiding kingdom till the time came
for God's glorious kingdom to be set up.</p>

<h4>Rome</h4>

<p>As the prophet watched the moving panorama of history,
foretold in symbols, he said:</p>

<p><i>Prophecy.</i>&mdash;"After this I saw in the night visions, and
behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly;
and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake
in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it
was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had
ten horns. I considered the horns, and, behold, there came
up among them another little horn, before whom there were
three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold,
in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth
speaking great things."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;As the iron of the image of Nebuchadnezzar's
dream fitly represented the "iron monarchy of Rome," so
here the dreadful beast, with its iron teeth, can be none other
than Rome, which followed Grecia in world dominion. It was
the most powerful, the most dominating, of all the beasts in
the prophetic series. A Roman Catholic writer, Cardinal
Manning, compresses into a paragraph the correspondence
of history to the likeness of the prophecy:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 446px;">
<img src="images/p125.jpg" width="446" height="296" alt="BATTLE OF ZAMA,

<span class="caption">BATTLE OF ZAMA,

By which Rome broke the power of Carthage, its
rival, and &quot;began the conquest of the world.&quot;</span>
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The legions of Rome occupied the circumference of the world.
The military roads which sprang from Rome traversed all the earth; the
whole world was, as it were, held in peace and in tranquillity by the
universal presence of this mighty heathen empire. It was 'exceedingly
terrible,' according to the prophecies of Daniel; it was as it were of iron,
beating down and subduing the nations."&mdash;<i>"The Temporal Power of the
Pope" (London, 1862), p. 122.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus far every symbol of the prophet's vision finds its
exact and clear counterpart in history. A writer living in
the third century, in the days of imperial Rome, rejoiced to
see how exactly the prophecy was being fulfilled. Hippolytus
(counted a saint by the Catholic Church) wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Rejoice, blessed Daniel! thou hast not been in error! All these
things have come to pass. After this again thou hast told us of the beast,
dreadful and terrible. It has iron teeth and claws of brass; it devoured
and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it. Already
the iron rules; already it subdues and breaks all in pieces; already it
brings all the unwilling into subjection; already we see these things ourselves.
Now we glorify God, being instructed by thee."&mdash;<i>"Treatise on
Christ and Antichrist," sec. 33.</i></p></div>

<p>Now the prophetic outline comes to the time of the division
of the Roman Empire, introducing events of deepest
personal interest to us today.</p>


<h4>Part II</h4>

<h4>The Fourth Kingdom and the "Little Horn"</h4>

<p>It was the fourth great monarchy, Imperial Rome, and the
events to follow it, that engaged the anxious inquiry of the
prophet. He says:</p>

<p>"Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which
was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth
were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in
pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet; and of the ten
horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up,
and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes,
and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was
more stout than his fellows. I beheld, and the same horn
made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; until
the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the
saints of the Most High; and the time came that the saints
possessed the kingdom."</p>

<p>The prophet wanted to know the truth about it; and the
angel told him the truth. First, the angel said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth,
which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour
the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces."</p>

<p>The fourth kingdom, as we have seen, was Rome. As
Cardinal Manning said of the empire, "It was 'exceeding
terrible,' according to the prophecies of Daniel; it was as it
were of iron, breaking down and subduing the nations."</p>

<p>Of the ten horns that arose out of this fourth great empire,
the angel said:</p>

<p>"The ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that
shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall
be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings."</p>

<p>We look to the history of the Roman Empire, and what
do we see?&mdash;Just the picture of the prophecy. We see the
original Roman Empire of the West divided into lesser kingdoms.
We see the barbarian peoples of the North sweeping
down upon the empire, breaking it up, and establishing within
its boundaries the various kingdoms that are to this day represented
by the kingdoms of western Europe.</p>

<p>And as we watch the history at this point, we surely see
"another little horn," another land of power, rising among
the horns representing the kingdoms of divided Rome&mdash;a
kingdom, yet a kingdom "diverse" from the others. The
work of this power riveted the attention of the prophet; and
it is of the greatest importance that we also should watch
closely to catch the lesson of the divine prophecy.</p>


<h4>Prophetic and Historic Pictures of the "Little Horn"</h4>

<p>This is plainly the picture presented by the prophet, as
we look again, observing details more closely.</p>

<p>The prophet beheld the division of the Roman Empire
into lesser kingdoms. Then, springing up among these kingdoms,
he saw the little-horn power subduing three of the ten
kingdoms, speaking great words, and making war with the
saints of God. It was to be a religious power, then, ruling
among the kings of the earth, and asserting religious dominion
over the faith and consciences of men. "The same horn made
war with the saints, and prevailed against them."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

EMPIRE BY THE HUNS

<span class="caption">THE INVASION OF THE ROMAN

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>We look to history, and this is what plainly appears:</p>

<p>We see, as described in the prophecy, a time when ten
contemporaneous kingdoms filled the territory of the original
Western Empire. Just there we see an ecclesiastical kingly
power rise to religious supremacy&mdash;the Roman Papacy. We
see, through its influence, three of the ten kingdoms overthrown,
"plucked up by the roots"&mdash;three Arian or heretical
kingdoms. And as we watch the history, we find this
power making "war with the saints" and prevailing against
them through long ages.</p>

<p>A Roman Catholic writer describes it in a paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Long ages ago, when Rome through the neglect of the Western emperors
was left to the mercy of the barbarous hordes, the Romans turned
to one figure for aid and protection, and asked him to rule them; and thus,
in this simple manner, the best title of all to kingly right, commenced the
temporal sovereignty of the popes. And meekly stepping to the throne of
C&aelig;sar, the vicar of Christ took up the scepter to which the emperors and
kings of Europe were to bow in reverence through so many ages."&mdash;<i>Rev.
James P. Conroy, in American Catholic Quarterly Review, April, 1911.</i></p></div>

<p>Yet again we look at the picture presented in prophecy.
Then we turn to history; and precisely where and when the
prophet saw the "little horn" coming up, we see the Roman
Papacy rising to supremacy. We see this ecclesiastical power
wielding a kingly scepter among the kingdoms of divided
Rome, exalting itself above them, with a look "more stout
than his fellows." We hear it speaking great words, and we
see it carrying on warfare against the saints.</p>

<p>Clearly, there was no other power in history, rising at
that time and in that place, which suggests the slightest correspondence
to the prophecy. In every detail the Roman
Papacy does correspond to it.</p>

<p>The prophetic outline has brought us to the rise of the
great apostasy, so fully dealt with in the New Testament
prophecy; but there are further specifications in this prophecy
of the seventh of Daniel which demand brief study.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_1260_YEARS_OF_DANIELS" id="THE_1260_YEARS_OF_DANIELS"></a>THE 1260 YEARS OF DANIEL'S PROPHECY</h2>


<p>Compressed into forty-four words, the age-long story of
the workings of the Roman Papacy is thus told by the angel
who interpreted Daniel's vision of the little horn:</p>

<p>"He shall speak great words against the Most High, and
shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change
times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a
time and times and the dividing of time." Dan. 7:25.</p>

<p>The spirit of this apostasy was abroad in apostolic days.
"The mystery of iniquity doth already work," said the apostle
Paul. 2 Thess. 2:7. And this power is to continue to work
until the end, when it will be destroyed by the brightness of
Christ's coming. Verse 8.</p>


<h4>A Prophetic Period</h4>

<p>But according to the word of the angel to Daniel, there
was to be a period during which, in a special sense, the Papacy
was to hold supremacy over the saints and the times and the
laws of the Most High.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"They shall be given into his hand until a time and times
and the dividing of time." In the Scriptures the word
"time," used in this manner, means a year: "at the end of
times, even years." Dan. 11:13, margin. Therefore a time
(one year) and times (two years) and the dividing of time
(half a year) means three years and a half. The same period
is mentioned twice in the twelfth chapter of Revelation, once
(verse 14) as "a time, and times, and half a time," and again
(verse 6) as "a thousand two hundred and threescore days."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/p132.jpg" width="448" height="42" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>But in the symbolic representations of time in prophecy,
a day stands for a year (see Eze. 4:5, 6, and other scriptures).
Thus the prophecy foretold a long period of 1260 years during
which papal supremacy would continue.</p>

<p>Now we may ask, When was this supremacy to begin?
what would mark the rise of the Papacy to acknowledged supremacy?
and what events mark the ending of the 1260 years?</p>


<h4>A Pivotal Point in History</h4>

<p>The answer of history to the voice of prophecy is clear.</p>

<p>The sixth century was a pivotal period in the history of
the world. The bishops of Rome had been asserting the
claims of that seat (or "see") above all others. Justinian was
emperor of the East. Of Justinian and his time Bury says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He may be likened to a colossal Janus bestriding the way of passage
between the ancient and medieval worlds.... His military achievements
decided the course of the history of Italy, and affected the development
of Western Europe;... and his ecclesiastical authority influenced
the distant future of Christendom."&mdash;<i>"History of the Later Roman
Empire," Vol. I, pp. 351-353.</i></p></div>

<p>Of this turning point in the world's history, Finlay says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The changes of centuries passed in rapid succession before the eyes
of one generation."&mdash;<i>"Greece under the Romans," p. 231.</i></p></div>

<p>Just here we find the Papacy lifted definitely into acknowledged
supremacy. Imperial Rome had already left its ancient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
seat to the Papacy, the imperial throne being no longer maintained
at Rome. The Bishop of Rome was left the chief
figure in the ancient seat of the C&aelig;sars. The prophecy of
Rev. 13:2 had said of the relation of the old imperial power
to the Papacy, "The dragon gave him his power, and his seat,
and great authority." The seat was given, and now imperial
Rome was to give to papal Rome the definite recognition of
its supreme power and "great authority."</p>


<h4>Papal Supremacy Officially Recognized</h4>

<p>In <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 533 the emperor Justinian promulgated a letter, having
the force of an imperial decree, recognizing the absolute headship
of the Bishop of Rome over the churches. It declared:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We have been sedulous to subject and unite all the priests of the
Orient throughout its whole extent to the see of Your Holiness.... For
we do not suffer that anything which is mooted, however clear and
unquestionable,
pertaining to the state of the churches, should fail to be made
known to Your Holiness, as being the head of all the churches. For, as we
have said before, we are zealous for the increase of the honor and authority
of your see in all respects."&mdash;<i>Cod. Justin., lib. 1, title 1, Baronii
"Annales Ecclesiastici," Tom. VII, an. 533, sec. 12 (Translation as given
in "The Petrine Claims," by R.F. Littledale, p. 293).</i></p></div>

<p>From this decree (for such it really was) the Roman authorities
date the official recognition of the supremacy of the
Papacy. Some have taken a later decree by Emperor Phocas
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 606) as a starting point. But Dr. Croly says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The highest authorities among the civilians and annalists of Rome
spurn the idea that Phocas was the founder of the supremacy of Rome;
they ascend to Justinian as the only legitimate source, and rightly date
the title from the memorable year 533."&mdash;<i>"The Apocalypse of St. John,"
pp. 172, 173.</i></p></div>


<h4>The Sword of Empire Cleaves the Way</h4>

<p>The "great authority" had been recognized. But at this
time heretical Arian powers compassed the papal seat about.
The Arian Vandals were persecuting Catholics in Africa,
Corsica, and Sardinia, and an Arian Gothic king ruled Italy
from Ravenna, his capital. The imperial arms, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
were at the service of orthodoxy. In 533-534 Justinian's
famous general, Belisarius, uprooted the Vandals. The war
for the faith and the empire was carried into Italy also,
against the Arian Goths. In 536 Belisarius, unopposed, entered
Rome at the invitation of the Pope. But the next year
the Goths rallied all their forces to retake the city. It was
a crisis in the struggle for Italy. "If a single post had given
way," says Gibbon, "the Romans, and Rome itself, were
irrecoverably lost." The Goths withdrew, defeated, in 538;
and this defeat, says Hodgkin, dug "the grave of the Gothic
monarchy in Italy."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 445px;">

<span class="caption">THE POPE ENTERING ST. PETER&#39;S

The famous statue of St. Peter
may be seen on the right.</span>
</div>

<p>Though the conflict went on for years before the Goths
were rooted up, this defeat of 538 was a crucial hour in their
history. Finlay says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"With the conquest of Rome by Belisarius, the history of the ancient
city may be considered as terminating; and with his defense against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Witiges [538] commences the history of the Middle Ages."&mdash;<i>"Greece
under the Romans," p 295.</i></p></div>

<p>Roughly speaking, the Middle Ages and the age of papal
supremacy and power were the same.</p>

<p>Not only was there this telling stroke by the imperial
sword in 538, helping to clear the way before the Papacy, but
at this same time the first of a new order of popes was placed
upon the papal throne by the imperial arms. Pope Silverius,
accused of sympathy with the Goths, was deposed by Belisarius
in 537. The emperor intervened, and the question of
the validity of his deposition was held up by the emperor
until 538. In that year, as Schaff says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Vigilius, a pliant creature of Theodora, ascended the papal chair
under the military protection of Belisarius (538-554)."&mdash;<i>"History of the
Christian Church," Vol. III, p. 327.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>With him begins a new order. Though personally he was
humiliated by the emperor's demands, and the Papacy itself
was brought into a state of subjection that it had not known
even under heretical Gothic kings, yet this very arbitrary
use of the papal prerogative by Justinian, strengthened the
idea that the Pope of Rome was the supreme authority in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
religion, to speak for the universal church. In Bemont and
Monod's textbook on "Medieval Europe," page 120, we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Down to the sixth century all popes are declared saints in the
martyrologies. Vigilius (537<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>-555) is the first of a series of popes who no
longer bear this title, which is henceforth sparingly conferred. From this
time on the popes, more and more involved in worldly events, no longer
belong solely to the church; they are men of the state, and then rulers
of the state."</p></div>


<h4>A Persecuting Power</h4>

<p>Following Vigilius came Pelagius I (556-560), who ascended
the throne by "the military aid of Narses," then the
imperial general in Italy. And Pelagius, who had been set in
the papal see by imperial power, began to demand that the
sword of the empire should be used against bishops or members
in the church who did not give way to the authority of the
Pope. His letters on this subject "are an unqualified defense
of the principles of persecution." (See "Dictionary of Christian
Biography," by Smith and Wace, art. "Pope Pelagius.")</p>

<p>The prophecy declared that the Papacy would be given
special supremacy during a period of 1260 years.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 533 came the memorable imperial declaration
recognizing that supremacy, and in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 538 came the stroke
with the sword of Rome, cleaving the way; and there began
the new order of popes&mdash;"men of the state, and then rulers
of the state."</p>

<p>Thus decisive events clearly mark the beginning of the
prophetic period of the 1260 years. And just 1260 years
from the decree of 533, in recognition of the papal supremacy,
came a decree, in 1793, aimed against that supremacy; and
just 1260 years from that stroke with the sword at Rome in
behalf of the Papacy, came a stroke with the sword at Rome
against the Papacy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE END OF THE 1260 YEARS</h3>


<p>As the generation in which the papal power rose to supremacy
was a turning-point in the history of the world, so,
too, was the generation in which the 1260 years of its supremacy
came to an end.</p>

<p>This measuring line of prophecy does more than run from
date to date. It connects two great crises in human history,
the events of the first tending to establish the papal rule over
men, the events of the second signalizing a breaking of those
bands.</p>


<h4>A Crisis in History</h4>

<p>Papal supremacy came at that time of which Finlay says,
"The changes of centuries passed in rapid succession before
the eyes of one generation." The measuring line of 1260
years runs on through the centuries till, lo, its end touches
another time of crisis,&mdash;Europe in the convulsions of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
French Revolution, when again changes, ordinarily requiring
centuries, were wrought out before the eyes of men within
the space of a few years. Lamartine wrote of that time:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"These five years are five centuries for France."&mdash;<i>"History of the
Girondists," book 61, sec. 16 (Vol. III), p. 544.</i></p></div>

<p>And the events of these times proclaimed the prophetic period
of papal supremacy ended at last.</p>

<p>Thus, in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 533 came the notable decree of the Papacy's
powerful supporter, recognizing its supremacy; and then the
decisive stroke by the sword at Rome in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 538, cleaving
the way for the new order of popes&mdash;the rulers of state.</p>

<p>Exactly 1260 years later, in 1793, came the notable decree
of the Papacy's once powerful supporter, France,&mdash;"the eldest
son of the church,"&mdash;aiming to abolish church and religion,
followed by a decisive stroke with the sword at Rome against
the Papacy, in 1798.</p>


<h4>Significant Events of the French Revolution</h4>

<p>Of the decree of 1793, W.H. Hutton says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On Nov. 26, 1793, the Convention, of which seventeen bishops and
some clergy were members, decreed the abolition of all religion."&mdash;<i>"Age
of Revolution," p. 156.</i></p></div>

<p>The frenzy of the days of the Terror presented the spectacle
of outraged humanity, goaded to desperation by centuries
of oppression in the name of religion and divine right,
rising up and madly breaking every restraint. Because in
the minds of the people the Papacy stood for religion, they
blindly struck at religion itself, and at God, in whose name
the papal church had done its cruel work through the centuries.</p>

<p>In the prophecy of Rev. 11:3-13 these events of the wild
days of the French Revolution are specifically referred to as
coming at the close of the prophetic period of the 1260 years.
The prophetic picture was so clear that over a hundred years
before the time, Jurieu, an eminent French student of prophecy,
wrote that he could "not doubt that 'tis France," the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
chief supporter of the Papacy, that would give the shock as
of an earthquake to the great spiritual Babylonian city. He
wrote of France, one of the ten parts of divided Rome:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This tenth part of the city shall fall, with respect to the Papacy;
it shall break with Rome, and the Roman religion."&mdash;<i>"The Accomplishment
of the Prophecies" (London, 1687), part 2, p. 265.</i></p></div>

<p>And so it came to pass. Far beyond France the movement
reached. Canon Trevor says of the wave of revolt against
absolutism that passed over Europe:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is worthy of observation that only those nations which eschewed
popery were able to resist the tide. Every throne and every church,
without exception, that owned the supremacy of Rome, was prostrated
in the dust."&mdash;<i>"Rome and Its Papal Rulers," p. 436.</i></p></div>

<p>The decree of the French Convention in 1793 was followed
by the stroke with the sword at Rome in 1798. The full
history is told in fewest words by a Roman Catholic writer,
Rev. Joseph Rickaby, of the Jesuit Society:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When, in 1797, Pope Pius VI fell grievously ill, Napoleon gave
orders that in the event of his death no successor should be elected to his
office, and that the Papacy should be discontinued.</p>

<p>"But the Pope recovered. The peace was soon broken; Berthier
entered Rome on the tenth of February, 1798, and proclaimed a republic.
The aged pontiff refused to violate his oath by recognizing it, and was
hurried from prison to prison in France. Broken with fatigue and sorrows,
he died on the nineteenth of August, 1799, in the French fortress
of Valence, aged eighty-two years. No wonder that half Europe thought
Napoleon's veto would be obeyed, and that with the Pope the Papacy
was dead."&mdash;<i>"The Modern Papacy," p. 1 (Catholic Truth Society, London).</i></p></div>

<p>These events of the French Revolution marked the ending
of the prophetic period of papal supremacy. A "deadly
wound" had been given the Papacy. And the blow with
the sword at Rome was struck in 1798, just 1260 years from
the year 538, when the sword of empire struck that decisive
blow against the Goths at Rome, and prepared the way for
the new order of popes, the kingly rulers of church and state.</p>

<p>Of the condition of the Papacy at this time Canon Trevor
says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Papacy was extinct: not a vestige of its existence remained;
and among all the Roman Catholic powers not a finger was stirred in its
defense. The Eternal City had no longer prince or pontiff; its bishop
was a dying captive in foreign lands; and the decree was already announced
that no successor would be allowed in his place."&mdash;<i>"Rome and
Its Papal Rulers," p. 440.</i></p></div>

<p>"No wonder that half Europe," the Jesuit writer says,
"thought Napoleon's veto would be obeyed, and that with
the Pope the Papacy was dead." But he adds that "since
then the Papacy has been lifted to a pinnacle of spiritual
power" unreached before.</p>

<p>The stroke dealt the Papacy by the French Revolution
was not to be the ending of it, by any means, according to
the prophecy. These events proclaimed the ending of the
prophetic period of special supremacy. Another prophecy
distinctly indicates that following the deadly blow there would
come a revival of the Papacy's influence, just as the Catholic
writer describes it. The prophet John, speaking of this same
power, says:</p>

<p>"I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and
his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered
after the beast.... And they worshiped the beast, saying,
Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with
him?" Rev. 13:3, 4.</p>

<p>We see the healing process still going on, with evidences
multiplying that the world is more and more wondering after
the papal power.</p>


<h4>A New Era of Liberty and Enlightenment</h4>

<p>With the ending of the 1260 years of papal supremacy, a
new order was ushered in. The Papacy had stood for absolutism
in state as well as church. Now the power of absolutism
was broken. "Absolute monarchy," Edmund Burke
said at the time, "breathed its last without a struggle." There
came the dawn of an era of greater religious liberty and enlightenment,
that has spread blessings over all lands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>The prophecy had said of the Papacy, that the saints
and the times and laws of the Most High were to be "given
into his hand" for 1260 years. As foretold in Christ's prophecy
(Matt. 24:22), these days of the tribulation of God's
saints were "shortened." The power of the Reformation
weakened the oppressing hand, even before the prophetic
period ran out. And when the full 1260 years closed, the
world saw the grip of that papal hand yet further loosened,
and God's providence at work preparing the way for a world-wide
proclamation of His gospel, bearing witness against the
perversions of the papal apostasy, and restoring to men the
Word and laws of the Most High.</p>

<p>The record of history witnesses that this time prophecy
of the 1260 years of papal supremacy was exactly fulfilled.
The Lord speaks in prophecy that men may know that He is
the living God. In these time prophecies of His Word, He
gives assurance not only that this troubled world has not
escaped from the hand of its Maker, but that its times are in
His hand also; and that when the time of His divine purpose
fully comes, He will surely cut His work short in righteousness,
and end the reign of sin on earth.</p>

<p>As the prophetic period of Dan. 7:25 meets its fulfilment
in the history of the Papacy, even so, we shall see, the work
of the Roman Church answers to the further specifications
regarding the doings of this "little horn" of Daniel's prophecy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE WORK OF THE "LITTLE HORN" POWER</h2>


<p>The prophetic picture of the rise and work of the "little
horn" finds its exact counterpart in the history of the Roman
Papacy:</p>

<p><i>The Place.</i>&mdash;The little horn was seen by the prophet
rising in the field of the Roman Empire. That was the very
place where the great kingdom of the Papacy appeared, taking
the name of Roman.</p>

<p><i>The Time.</i>&mdash;The rise of the ecclesiastical kingdom of
the little-horn power in the prophecy followed the breaking
up of the Roman Empire into the ten kingdoms. Just so the
ecclesiastical kingdom of the Roman Papacy rises to view in
history immediately following the division of the empire.</p>

<p><i>The Period of Supremacy.</i>&mdash;The prophecy allotted 1260
years to the full supremacy of this power. History responds
that from the beginning of the papal supremacy, in the days
of Justinian, a period of 1260 years brings us into the stirring
events of the last decade of the eighteenth century, that gave
to the Papacy a deadly wound.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>One further set of specifications remains for study:</p>

<p><i>The Work.</i>&mdash;Of the nature and work of the power represented
by the little horn, the prophecy declares:</p>

<p>"He shall speak great words against the Most High, and
shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to
change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand
until a time and times and the dividing of time." Dan. 7:25.</p>

<p>Do we find in the record that the Church of Rome has
fulfilled these specifications also? The Scripture prophecy
is absolutely a word-photograph of the workings of the papal
church. Look at the main features:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Speaking great words against the Most High.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">2. Wearing out the saints of the Most High.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">3. Thinking to change the times and the laws of the Most High.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Every count in the indictment may be clearly proved,
and that by testimony from Roman Catholic sources</p>


<h4>"He Shall Speak Great Words Against the
Most High"</h4>

<p>As Daniel observed the little-horn power, he heard it
speaking "very great things." The angel declared that these
great swelling words were really against the Most High. And
what could be more against the honor of the Most High than
that to mortal man should be ascribed the titles and attributes
of divinity? Here are some of the "great words:"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All the names which are attributed to Christ in Scripture, implying
His supremacy over the church, are also attributed to the Pope."&mdash;<i>Bellarmine,
"On the Authority of Councils," book 2, chap. 17.</i></p></div>

<p>This ruling has been actually applied through the ages.
Says Elliott:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Look at the Sicilian ambassadors prostrated before him [Pope
Martin IV] with the cry, 'Lamb of God! that takest away the sins of
the world!'"&mdash;<i>"Hor&aelig; Apocalyptic&aelig;," part 4, chap. 5, sec. 2.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Pope is of so great dignity and excellence, that he is not merely
man, but as if God, and the vicar of God (<i>non sit simplex homo, sed
quasi Deus, et Dei vicarius</i>). The Pope alone is called most holy,...
divine monarch, and supreme emperor, and king of kings.... The Pope is
of so great dignity and power that he constitutes one and the same
tribunal with Christ (<i>faciat unum et idem tribunal cum Christo</i>), so
that whatsoever the Pope does seems to proceed from the mouth of God
(<i>abore Dei</i>)."&mdash;<i>"Prompta Bibliotheca" (Ferraris), art. "Papa;"
Ferraris's Ecclesiastical Dictionary (Roman Catholic), art. "The Pope."
Quoted in Guinness's "Romanism and the Reformation," p. 16.</i></p></div>

<p>These are no merely extravagant adulations of the Dark
Ages, to be repudiated by the moderns; these terms express
the unchanging doctrinal claims of the Roman Church, that
put man in the place of God. The modern Pope Leo XIII,
in an encyclical letter dated June 20, 1894, repeated the
claim:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty."&mdash;<i>"The Great
Encyclical Letters of Leo XIII" (New York, Benziger Brothers), p. 304.</i></p></div>

<p>Thus does the Papacy "speak great words against the
Most High."</p>


<h4>"And Shall Wear Out the Saints of the
Most High"</h4>

<p>All through the Dark Ages we catch glimpses of the ruthless
hand of Rome laid upon simple believers in God's Holy
Word; but plans for wholesale wearing out of the saints of
God were devised as the Waldenses and others rose to a widespread
work of witnessing, heralds of the dawn of the coming
Reformation,&mdash;</p>

<p>Pope Innocent III gave orders concerning them as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Therefore by this present apostolical writing, we give you a strict
command that, by whatever means you can, you destroy all these heresies
and expel from your diocese all who are polluted with them. You
shall exercise the rigor of ecclesiastical power against them and all those
who have made themselves suspected by associating with them. They
may not appeal from your judgments, and, if necessary, you may cause
the princes and people to suppress them with the sword."&mdash;<i>Quoted from
Migne, 214, col. 71, in Thatcher and McNeal's "Source Book for Medieval
History," p. 210.</i></p></div>

<p>As the truth spread, so also the papal church redoubled
its efforts by sword and flame. The historian Lecky
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"That the Church of Rome has shed more innocent blood than any
other institution that has ever existed among mankind, will be questioned
by no Protestant who has a competent knowledge of history. The memorials,
indeed, of many of her persecutions are now so scanty that it is
impossible to form a complete conception of the multitude of her victims,
and it is quite certain that no powers of imagination can adequately
realize their sufferings."&mdash;<i>"History of the Rise and Influence of the Spirit
of Rationalism in Europe," Vol. II, p. 32.</i></p></div>

<p>Motley, in his "Rise of the Dutch Republic" (part 3,
chap. 2), tells how Philip II of Spain&mdash;who declared that
he would "never consent to be the sovereign of heretics"&mdash;sent
the Duke of Alva to take over the Netherlands:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Early in the year the most sublime sentence of death was promulgated
which has ever been pronounced since the creation of the world.
The Roman tyrant [Nero] wished that his enemies' heads were all upon
a single neck, that he might strike them off at a blow; the Inquisition
assisted Philip to place the heads of all his Netherlands subjects upon a
single neck for the same fell purpose. Upon February 16, 1568, a sentence
of the Holy Office condemned all the inhabitants of the Netherlands
to death as heretics. From this universal doom only a few persons,
especially named, were excepted. A proclamation of the king, dated
ten days later, confirmed this decree of the Inquisition, and ordered
it to be carried into instant execution, without regard to age, sex, or
condition.
This is probably the most concise death warrant that was ever
framed. Three millions of people, men, women, and children, were sentenced
to the scaffold in three lines."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Roman Catholic writers admit that the papal church has
sought to exterminate what it calls heresy, by the power of
the sword.</p>

<p>The <i>Western Watchman</i> (St. Louis), Dec. 24, 1908, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The church has persecuted.... Protestants were persecuted in
France and Spain with the full approval of the church authorities. We
have always defended the persecution of the Huguenots, and the Spanish
Inquisition. Wherever and whenever there is honest Catholicity, there
will be a clear distinction drawn between truth and error, and Catholicity
and all forms of error. When she thinks it good to use physical
force, she will use it."</p></div>

<p>Prof. Alfred Baudrillart, rector of the Catholic Institute
of Paris, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Catholic Church is a respecter of conscience and of liberty....
She has, and she loudly proclaims that she has, a 'horror of
blood.' Nevertheless, when confronted by heresy, she does not content
herself with persuasion; arguments of an intellectual and moral order
appear to her insufficient, and she has recourse to force, to corporal
punishment,
to torture. She creates tribunals like those of the Inquisition,
she calls the laws of the state to her aid, if necessary she encourages a
crusade, or a religious war, and all her 'horror of blood' practically
culminates
into urging the secular power to shed it, which proceeding is
almost more odious&mdash;for it is less frank&mdash;than shedding it herself.
Especially did she act thus in the sixteenth century with regard to Protestants.
Not content to reform morally, to preach by example, to convert
people by eloquent and holy missionaries, she lit in Italy, in the Low
Countries, and above all in Spain, the funeral piles of the Inquisition.
In France under Francis I and Henry II, in England under Mary Tudor,
she tortured the heretics, whilst both in France and Germany during the
second half of the sixteenth and the first half of the seventeenth century
if she did not actually begin, at any rate she encouraged and
actively aided, the religious wars."&mdash;<i>"The Catholic Church, the Renaissance
and Protestantism" (London, Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr&uuml;bner &amp; Co., Ltd.,
1908), pp. 182, 183.</i></p></div>

<p>She has done it&mdash;the Church of Rome has worn out the
saints of the Most High. The prophet in vision saw an ecclesiastical
kingly power rise among the kingdoms of the divided
Roman Empire. Its look was more stout than its fellows,
and the prophet heard it speaking "very great things," and
saw it wearing out the saints of the Most High through the
long centuries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Guilty!" is the clear verdict of history, against the
Church of Rome on these two counts of the prophetic indictment.</p>


<h4>"And Think to Change Times and Laws"</h4>

<p>The power that was to speak great words against the
Most High, and to wear out the saints of the Most High,
was further&mdash;in its self-exalting opposition to God&mdash;to assume
to lay hands upon times and laws, evidently the
times and the laws of the Most High; for to say that such
a power would lay hands on the laws of men, changing or
setting aside human legislation, would signify less than the
preceding counts. This third specification states a climax
in the indictment&mdash;the self-exalting, persecuting power was
to lay hands upon the very law of the Most High. It is
clearly the same power that the apostle Paul said would rise
to dominion after his time: "Then shall be revealed the lawless
one." 2 Thess. 2:8, A.R.V.</p>


<h4>God's Law Unchangeable</h4>

<p>Just as the laws of a government express its character,
so the law of God is a reflection of the divine character. "The
law of the Lord is perfect." Ps. 19:7. "Wherefore the law
is holy," said the apostle, "and the commandment holy, and
just, and good." Rom. 7:12.</p>

<p>Jesus declared, "I delight to do Thy will, O My God: yea,
Thy law is within My heart." Ps. 40:8. And He maintained
the unchangeable, enduring integrity of that law: "Verily I
say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle
shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." Matt.
5:18.</p>

<p>But in Daniel's prophecy is foretold the rise of this power
that was to <i>think</i> to change the times and the laws of the
Most High.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, again, the evidence points straight to the Church of
Rome; for it is a fact that the Papacy has laid violent hands
on the law of God&mdash;upon the precept, too, that deals with
sacred time&mdash;and has <i>thought</i> to change it.</p>

<p>In a volume to be seen in the British Museum, dated 1545,
the following comment on Dan. 7:25 is attributed to Philipp
Melanchthon, the Reformer, associate of Luther (reproduced
with the old English spelling):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He changeth the tymes and lawes that any of the sixe worke dayes
commanded of God will make them unholy and idle dayes when he lyste,
or of their owne holy dayes abolished make worke dayes agen, or when
they changed ye Saterday into Sondaye.... They have changed God's
lawes and turned them into their owne tradicions to be kept above God's
precepts."&mdash;<i>"Exposition of Daniel the Prophete," Gathered out of Philipp
Melanchthon, Johan Ecolampadius, etc., by George Joye, 1545, p. 119.</i></p></div>

<p>This is exactly what the power represented by the little
horn was to assume to do. The commandment of God is
plain:</p>

<p>"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days
shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is
the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any
work.... For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth,
the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day:
wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed
it." Ex. 20:8-11.</p>


<h4>A Change in Practice</h4>

<p>But in general practice there has been a change&mdash;the
first day is commonly observed instead of the seventh day,
which the Lord declares he blessed and made holy. The Roman
Catholic Church points exultingly to the fact that this
change, so universally allowed today, has come about solely
through church tradition without Scriptural authority. For
instance, one Catholic writer says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"You will tell me that Saturday was the <i>Jewish</i> Sabbath, but that
the <i>Christian</i> Sabbath has been changed to Sunday. Changed! but by
whom? Who has authority to change an express commandment of Almighty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
God? When God has spoken and said, Thou shalt keep holy
the seventh day, who shall dare to say, Nay, thou mayest work and
do all manner of worldly business on the seventh day; but thou shalt
keep holy the first day in its stead? This is a most important question,
which I know not how you can answer.</p>

<p>"You are a Protestant, and you profess to go by the Bible and the
Bible only; and yet in so important a matter as the observance of one day
in seven as a holy day, you go against the plain letter of the Bible, and put
another day in the place of that day which the Bible has commanded.
The command to keep holy the seventh day is one of the ten commandments;
you believe that the other nine are still binding; who gave you
authority to tamper with the fourth? If you are consistent with your
own principles, if you really follow the Bible and the Bible only, you
ought to be able to produce some portion of the New Testament in which
this fourth commandment is expressly altered."&mdash;<i>"Library of Christian
Doctrine: Why Don't You Keep the Holy Sabbath Day?" (Burns and Oates
London), p. 3.</i></p></div>

<p>Every one who studies the question must recognize the
fact that there is no change authorized in Scripture. As
Canon Eyton, of the Church of England, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is no word, no hint, in the New Testament about abstaining
from work on Sunday.... Into the rest of Sunday no divine law enters."&mdash;<i>"The
Ten Commandments" (Tr&uuml;bner &amp; Co.), London.</i></p></div>

<p>Dr. Heylyn, of the Church of England, wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Take which you will, either the Fathers or the moderns, and we
shall find no Lord's day instituted by any apostolical mandate; no Sabbath
set on foot by them upon the first day of the week."&mdash;<i>"History
of the Sabbath," part 2, chap. 1.</i></p></div>

<p>Authorities, both Protestant and Catholic, freely acknowledge
that there is no divine authority for Sunday keeping.
There has been a change in practice and teaching, but with
no Scriptural authority.</p>


<h4>What the Papacy Claims</h4>

<p>The prophecy of Daniel 7 forewarned all that the ecclesiastical
power that was to rise upon the division of the Roman
Empire would <i>think</i> to change the times and the laws of the
Most High. The Papacy steps forward and claims boldly
that the church has power to set aside Scripture, to institute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
holy times, and even to change the day made holy and commanded
by the Almighty as the day of rest for His people.</p>

<p>In a Catholic work, "An Abridgment of the Christian
Doctrine," by Dr. Henry Turberville, page 61, we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Question.</i>&mdash;By whom was the change [of the Sabbath] made?</p>

<p>"<i>Answer.</i>&mdash;By the rulers of the church, the apostles who kept the
Lord's day....</p>

<p>"<i>Ques.</i>&mdash;How do you prove that the church hath power to establish
feasts and holy days?</p>

<p>"<i>Ans.</i>&mdash;By the very fact of changing the Sabbath to Sunday; this
change Protestants allow; and therefore they contradict themselves by
keeping Sunday strictly and breaking most other feasts commanded by
the same church.</p>

<p>"<i>Ques.</i>&mdash;How prove you that?</p>

<p>"<i>Ans.</i>&mdash;Because by keeping Sunday they acknowledge the church's
power to ordain feasts and to command them under sin; and by not keeping
the rest commanded by her, they deny that she has power."</p></div>

<p>It is the doctrine taught in the standard catechisms of the
Roman Church:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Question.</i>&mdash;Have you any other way of proving that the church
has power to institute festivals of precept?</p>

<p>"<i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Had she not such power, she could not have done that
in which all modern religionists agree with her,&mdash;she could not have
substituted the observance of Sunday the first day of the week, for the
observance of Saturday the seventh day, a change for which there is no
Scriptural authority."&mdash;<i>Keenan's "Doctrinal Catechism," p. 174.</i></p></div>

<p>Thus the Papacy proclaims itself the power that has
<i>thought</i> to change the precepts of the Most High.</p>

<p>On every count, the Roman Church is the counterpart of
the little horn of Daniel 7. Before our eyes&mdash;in the common
practice of Christendom&mdash;the commandment of God
regarding sacred time is made void by the traditions of men.</p>

<p>The prophecy indicated that there would come a call for
a reformation in this matter. Speaking of the warfare against
the saints and the times and laws of the Most High, to be
waged by the little-horn power, the angel said:</p>

<p>"They shall be given into his hand until a time and times
and the dividing of time." Dan. 7:25.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>In other words, when the 1260 years should expire, we
should expect, according to the prophecy, to see a breaking
of the Papacy's persecuting power over believers, a spreading
abroad of the Holy Scriptures, and a work of reformation
that would lift up the truths of God's Word, and call believers
to keep once again the holy time and the holy law
of the Most High.</p>

<p>The prophecy of Daniel 7 is one of God's special messages
for all men in these last days, picturing the rise and history
of the Papacy, and warning all against accepting its perversions
of God's truth or recognizing its attempted change in
the law of the Most High. Thank God for the "sure word
of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto
a light that shineth in a dark place." We are to follow the
Lord and obey him, not this power that has risen up in opposition
to him.</p>

<p>The angel's interpretation in this chapter does not leave
the apostasy triumphant:</p>

<p>"The judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his
dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end."</p>

<p>Then the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms
of the Most High, "and all dominions shall serve and obey
Him."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BIBLE_SABBATH" id="THE_BIBLE_SABBATH"></a>THE BIBLE SABBATH</h2>


<p>"He answered and said, Every plant, which My heavenly
Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up." Matt. 15:13.</p>

<p>The scribes had come to Jesus with the complaint, "Why
do Thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?"
Jesus answered them with another question, "Why do ye also
transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?"</p>

<p>They had thought that Christ was introducing novelties,
preaching new things, contrary to established church custom
and practice. He showed them that He really stood for
the old and established things of God's Word, and that their
own religious customs, however old, were really the novelties,
without divine authority. He said,</p>

<p>"In vain do they worship Me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men." And finally He added the words
quoted above, "Every plant, which My heavenly Father hath
not planted, shall be rooted up."</p>

<p>Let the principles be applied to the question of Sabbath
observance. Sometimes in our day those who preach the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
word of God regarding the abiding holiness of the seventh-day
Sabbath are accused of preaching new doctrines, contrary
to the traditions and customs of the church. But really,
the observance of Sunday, the first day, is the innovation;
the seventh-day Sabbath is of ancient foundation.</p>

<h4>Is the Seventh-day Sabbath a Plant of Our Heavenly
Father's Planting?</h4>

<p>Which of these two institutions has our heavenly Father
planted? It is possible to ascertain to a surety; for every
plant of His planting, every doctrine of His truth, will be
found rooted in the Holy Scriptures. 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.</p>


<h4>The Old Testament Record</h4>

<p><i>From the Beginning.</i>&mdash;When the Creator made the earth
and man upon it, He made the seventh day of the weekly
cycle His holy Sabbath.</p>

<p>"Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all
the host of them.... And God blessed the seventh day, and
sanctified it: because that in it He had rested from all His
work which God created and made." Gen. 2:1-3.</p>

<p>To sanctify is "to set apart," and so the day made holy
and blessed by God was set apart for man. Then it was, as
Jesus said, that "the Sabbath was made for man." Mark
2:27. Here the Sabbath institution was planted at the beginning
of the world.</p>

<p><i>At the Exodus.</i>&mdash;The people of Israel, in their bondage in
Egypt, had fallen away from the knowledge of God and become
corrupted by the idolatrous worship of Egypt, Hence,
as the Lord called them out to be His people, He tested their
loyalty to His law by observing how they regarded His holy
Sabbath:</p>

<p>"Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain
bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and
gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them,
whether they will walk in My law, or no." Ex. 16:4.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>So through the forty years the Lord sent the manna for
them to gather on the six working days, withholding it on the
Sabbath. (This scripture shows also that the Sabbath was a
part of God's law before He spoke it from Sinai.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 442px;">

A modern view of the summit
of Mt. Sinai." title="" />
<span class="caption">HOREB, THE SACRED MOUNT<br />

A modern view of the summit
of Mt. Sinai.</span>
</div>

<p><i>At Sinai.</i>&mdash;When the time came that the Lord would
speak His holy law from heaven, the eternal foundation of
His moral government, the Sabbath precept was enshrined in
the heart of it:</p>

<p>"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days
shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day
is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do
any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant,
nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger
that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made heaven
and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the
seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day,
and hallowed it." Ex. 20:8-11.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Through Israel's History.</i>&mdash;Sabbath keeping was the great
mark of loyalty to God. When Israel fell into idolatry, they
"observed times" (see 2 Kings 21:6),&mdash;doubtless such heathen
festivals to the sun god and other deities as were common
among the idolatrous nations. These observances of
other days meant Sabbath breaking. "Neither shall ye ...
observe times.... Ye shall keep My Sabbaths." Lev. 19:26-30.
The Lord had promised concerning Jerusalem:</p>

<p>"If ye diligently hearken unto Me, saith the Lord, to
bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath
day, but hallow the Sabbath day, to do no work therein;
then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and
princes sitting upon the throne of David,... and this city
shall remain forever." Jer. 17:24, 25.</p>

<p>The divine pleading was slighted, and Jerusalem's fall and
the Babylonian captivity came as the result of the Israelites'
disregard of God's holy day.</p>

<p>Thus throughout the inspired record of the Old Testament
the seventh-day Sabbath appears as a plant of the
heavenly Father's own planting.</p>


<h4>The New Testament Record</h4>

<p><i>The Example and Teaching of Jesus.</i>&mdash;It was Christ's
"custom" to worship on the seventh day. Luke 4:16.</p>

<p>Jesus, who Himself made the Sabbath at creation (John
1:3), taught that it was "made for man,"&mdash;for the human
race,&mdash;and declared, "The Son of man is Lord also of the
Sabbath." Mark 2:27, 28. It is, therefore, "the Lord's
day." Rev. 1:10.</p>

<p>He did on the Sabbath only that which was "lawful,"
or according to the law of God's holy day. Matt. 12:12.</p>

<p>He kept His Father's commandments throughout His
earthly life. John 15:10.</p>

<p>And giving instruction regarding events to take place
many years after His ascension, He showed that He recognized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the continued existence of the Sabbath in the command,
"Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on
the Sabbath day." Matt. 24:20.</p>

<span class="caption">CHRIST HEALING THE MAN

&quot;It is lawful to do well on the Sabbath

</div>

<p><i>Among New Testament Disciples.</i>&mdash;The women, after the
crucifixion, "rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment."
Luke 23:56.</p>

<p>Inspiration says that the apostle Paul's custom was to
preach the gospel publicly Sabbath after Sabbath. Acts
13:14; 16:13; 17:1, 2; 18:4. When the Gentiles of Antioch
heard the gospel preached by the apostle one Sabbath, they
"besought that these words might be preached to them the
next Sabbath." Acts 13:42.</p>

<p>Throughout the New Testament, written years after Christ's
ascension, the Holy Spirit, speaking of the seventh day, calls
it "the Sabbath" upwards of fifty times. "Sabbath" means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
rest; therefore when the Holy Spirit, in the Christian age,
calls the seventh day the rest day, it must infallibly be the
day of rest for Christians, the Christian Sabbath.</p>

<p>In the Levitical or sacrificial ordinances of the sanctuary
services there were annual sabbaths and feasts, associated
with meats and drinks and ceremonial observances. But in
appointing these the Lord specifically distinguished between
them and the one and only weekly Sabbath, which was from
the beginning. "These are the feasts of the Lord," He said,
"beside the Sabbaths of the Lord." Lev. 23:37, 38.</p>

<p>The annual festivals and sabbaths, like all the ordinances
of the Levitical service, were shadows of things to come, and
found their fulfilment in the great sacrifice of Calvary. Col.
2:16, 17.</p>

<p>But the Sabbath of the Lord was made blessed and holy
by God at the creation, before sin had entered the world,
before any sacrificial or shadowy service was instituted to
point to a coming Redeemer. It is a fundamental and primary
institution, a part of the moral order of God's government
for man, the same as the obligations set forth in each
of the other commandments.</p>

<p>And Inspiration declares the eternal perpetuity of the
blessed Sabbath day in the future home of the saved, when the
prophet describes the felicity of the redeemed, as from month
to month, and "from one Sabbath to another," all flesh shall
come to worship before the Lord. Isa. 66:23.</p>

<p>Thus we find the seventh-day Sabbath a plant of the
heavenly Father's planting, rooted deep in all Holy Scripture,
and abiding eternally in the world to come.</p>


<h4>Is the First-day Rest an Institution of God's
Planting?</h4>

<p>In the beginning, the first day was employed by God in
the work of creation. Gen. 1:1-5.</p>

<p>Throughout all the Old Testament history it was one of
"the six working days." Eze. 46:1.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the day of Christ's resurrection; but Inspiration says
specifically that "the Sabbath was past" when that "first
day of the week" came. Mark 16:1, 2. Inspiration called
this first day merely by the ordinary secular name in common
business use, with never a suggestion of attaching any sacredness
to the day. For some of the disciples it was a day of
journeying, in which the risen Christ joined them. Luke
24:13-29. Later He appeared to the other disciples in Jerusalem,
gathered not in meeting, but at supper in their common
dwelling house. Mark 16:14.</p>

<p>The only religious meeting recorded as occurring on the
first day of the week was that held at Troas. (See Acts 20:6-13.)
The context shows that it was an evening meeting,
after the Sabbath,&mdash;Saturday night, as we would call it,
for the Bible reckoning is from evening to evening. It was
the last time the believers were ever to see the apostle's face,
and as they lingered after the close of the Sabbath, he held
an all-night farewell meeting, breaking bread with the believers,
and leaving at daybreak Sunday morning for the
eighteen- or twenty-mile journey afoot, across country to
Assos. And while he spent the first day traveling afoot,
his companions were journeying by boat.</p>

<p>Conybeare and Howson (of the Church of England), in that
standard work, "Life and Epistles of St. Paul," tell the plain
fact of the inspired record, save that manifestly they should not
have applied the title "Jewish" to God's Sabbath; for it was
not the Sabbath of the Jews, but "the Sabbath of the Lord
thy God:"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It was the evening which succeeded the Jewish Sabbath. On the
Sunday morning the vessel was about to sail."&mdash;<i>Chapter 20, p. 520.</i></p></div>

<p>Describing the road between Troas and Assos, they add:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Strength and peace were surely sought and obtained by the apostle
from the Redeemer as he pursued his lonely road that Sunday afternoon
in spring among the oak woods and the streams of Ida."&mdash;<i>Id., p. 522.</i></p></div>

<p>Once again the "first day of the week" is mentioned, in
1 Cor. 16:2. But that scripture says no word of any sacredness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of the day or of any religious observance of it. The
apostle was gathering a fund for the poor at Jerusalem, and
asked every believer to "lay by" something every first day
of the week, so that the money would be ready when he came.
As Dean Stanley (Church of England) comments:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is nothing to prove public assemblies, inasmuch as the phrase &#960;&#945;&#961; &#949;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#969; ('by himself, at his own house') implies that the collection was
to be made individually and in private."</p></div>

<p>And Neander's Church History says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"All mentioned here is easily explained, if one simply thinks of the
ordinary beginning of the week in secular life."&mdash;<i>Vol. I, p. 339 (German
ed.).</i></p></div>

<p>To meet the emergency of need in Judea, these believers
were asked to look over their business affairs at the beginning
of each week, until Paul should come, laying aside a gift as
God had prospered them.</p>


<h4>No Sunday Sacredness in the New Testament</h4>

<p>This is the record&mdash;not one suggestion in all the New
Testament of Sunday sacredness, to say nothing of precept
or commandment of the Lord. The late R.W. Dale, D.D.,
a leading Congregationalist of England, wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is quite clear that, however rigidly or devotedly we may spend
Sunday, we are not keeping the Sabbath.... The Sabbath was founded
on a specific, divine command. We can plead no such command for the
observance of Sunday.... There is not a single line in the New Testament
to suggest that we incur any penalty by violating the supposed
sanctity of Sunday."&mdash;<i>"The Ten Commandments," pp. 106, 107.</i></p></div>

<p>That religious classic, Smith and Cheetham's "Dictionary
of Christian Antiquities," says that the "notion of a formal
substitution" of the first day for the seventh,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"and the transference to it, perhaps in a spiritualized form, of the
Sabbatical obligation established by the promulgation of the fourth
commandment, has no basis whatever, either in Holy Scripture or in
Christian antiquity."&mdash;<i>Article "Sabbath."</i></p></div>

<p>Dr. E.F. Hiscox, author of "The Baptist Manual," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There was and is a commandment to 'keep holy the Sabbath day,'
but that Sabbath was not Sunday. It will, however, be readily said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
and with some show of triumph, that the Sabbath was transferred from
the seventh to the first day of the week.... Where can the record of
such a transaction be found? Not in the New Testament&mdash;absolutely
not."&mdash;<i>The New York Examiner, Nov. 16, 1893.</i></p></div>

<p>Such declarations by well-known scholars might be multiplied,
but it is not necessary. The record is open&mdash;any
one may see it. There is not a word in the Holy Scripture
of any first-day sacredness. The Sunday institution is not
a plant of our heavenly Father's planting.</p>


<h4>How the Change Came About</h4>

<p>There has been no change of the Sabbath by divine authority.
Men may choose to rest on any other day, but that cannot
make such a day God's rest day, His holy Sabbath. One
cannot change one's birthday by celebrating another day as
such. It is a fact of history that on a certain day of the month
one was born. That fact cannot be changed by choosing to
celebrate another day as the birthday. Just so it is a fact
of divine history that God rested on a given day of the week,
and on no other. That made the seventh day His rest day.</p>

<p>It is different from other days in character also, for He
blessed it and made it holy. To deny the difference between
common days and the holy day is to say that when the great
Creator blesses and makes holy, it is a vain performance.
That cannot be. It would take away all hope of holiness
or salvation for men. The blessing is upon the day, as every
soul finds who keeps it by faith.</p>

<p>When men choose to set apart another day than that
blessed and sanctified of God, it is plainly a setting up of
the humanly appointed time against the divinely appointed
time. It is exalting man's sabbath against God's Sabbath.
It is man exalting himself "above all that is called God."
2 Thess. 2:4.</p>

<p>This was what made the Roman Papacy. The apostle
Paul wrote that in his day the spirit of lawlessness was already
working. He said it would lead to a "falling away" from the
truth of God, and the full exaltation of the man of sin.
2 Thessalonians 2. The falling away came. As Dr. Killen
(Presbyterian), of Ireland, says in the preface to his "Ancient
Church:"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the interval between the days of the apostles and the conversion
of Constantine, the Christian commonwealth changed its aspect....
Rites and ceremonies, of which neither Paul nor Peter ever heard, crept
into use, and then claimed the rank of divine institutions."</p></div>

<p>In his "Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine,"
Cardinal Newman (Roman Catholic) tells how rites and ceremonies
were borrowed from paganism:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Confiding then in the power of Christianity to resist the infection
of evil, and to transmute the very instruments and appendages of demon
worship to an evangelical use,... the rulers of the church from early
times were prepared, should the occasion arise, to adopt, or imitate, or
sanction the existing rites and customs of the populace, as well as the
philosophy of the educated class."&mdash;<i>Pages 371, 372.</i></p></div>

<p>Thus along with other adaptations came "the venerable
day of the sun" (Sunday). It was by gradual process that
it supplanted the Sabbath. Sir William Domville wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Centuries of the Christian era passed away before Sunday was
observed by the Christian church as a Sabbath. History does not furnish
us with a single proof or indication that it was at any time so observed
previous to the Sabbatical edict of Constantine in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
321."&mdash;<i>"Examination
of Six Texts," p. 291.</i></p></div>

<p>This law of Constantine's was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On the venerable day of the sun let the magistrates and people
residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed. In the country,
however, persons engaged in agriculture may freely and lawfully continue
their pursuits; because it often happens that another day is not so suitable
for grain sowing or for vine planting; lest by neglecting the proper
moment for such operations, the bounty of heaven should be lost. (Given
the 7th day of March, Crispus and Constantine being consuls each of them
for the second time.)"&mdash;<i>Schaff, "History of the Christian Church," Vol.
III, chap. 5, sec. 75.</i></p></div>

<p>Commenting on this law, Prof. Hutton Webster, of the
University of Nebraska, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This legislation by Constantine probably bore no relation to Christianity;
it appears, on the contrary, that the emperor, in his capacity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Pontifex Maximus, was only adding the day of the sun, the worship of
which was then firmly established in the Roman Empire, to the other
ferial days of the sacred calendar."</p>

<p>"What began, however, as a pagan ordinance, ended as a Christian
regulation; and a long series of imperial decrees, during the fourth, fifth,
and sixth centuries, enjoined with increasing stringency abstinence from
labor on Sunday."&mdash;<i>"Rest Days," pp. 122, 270.</i></p></div>

<p>Dean Stanley (Church of England) writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The retention of the old pagan name <i>Dies Solis</i>, or Sunday, for the
weekly Christian festival, is, in a great measure, owing to the union of
pagan and Christian sentiment with which the first day of the week was
recommended by Constantine to his subjects, pagan and Christian alike,
as the 'venerable day of the sun.'"&mdash;<i>"History of the Eastern Church,"
lecture 6, par. 15.</i></p></div>

<p>Thus the Sunday institution comes in, marked by its
pagan origin, and adapted to ecclesiastical purposes by the
church of the "falling away" that grew into the Roman Papacy.
To quote again from the Baptist author, Dr. Hiscox:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Of course, I quite well know that Sunday did come into use in early
Christian history as a religious day, as we learn from the Christian Fathers
and other sources. But what a pity that it comes branded with the mark
of paganism, and christened with the name of the sun god, when adopted
and sanctioned by the papal apostasy, and bequeathed as a sacred legacy
to Protestantism."&mdash;<i>New York Examiner, Nov. 16, 1893.</i></p></div>

<p>No wonder that with the coming of the latter days, and
the proclamation of the message of preparation for Christ's
second coming, there should come a call to Christians to follow
Christ and Holy Scripture in keeping God's holy Sabbath.</p>

<p>Again the voice of Jesus is heard in protest against traditions
that make void the commandment of God.</p>

<p>"Every plant," He says, "which My heavenly Father hath
not planted, shall be rooted up." Matt. 15:13.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<h2>GLIMPSES OF SABBATH KEEPING AFTER NEW TESTAMENT TIMES</h2>


<p>Not at once did the innovation of Sunday observance
set aside the Sabbath of the Lord in the practice of even the
general church. And through history, when the general
church had fallen away, we catch glimpses here and there of
faithful witnesses to God's holy Sabbath truth.</p>


<h4>First Centuries</h4>

<p>An old English writer, Professor Brerewood, of Gresham
College, London, put in shortest phrase what many writers say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They know little who do not know that the ancient Sabbath did
remain and was observed by the Eastern churches three hundred years
after our Saviour's passion."&mdash;<i>"Treatise on the Sabbath," p. 77.</i></p></div>


<h4>Fourth Century</h4>

<p>Canon 29, of the Council of Laodicea (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 364), shows
that the ecclesiastical system was laboring to put an end to
Sabbath keeping:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Christians shall not Judaize and be idle on Saturday [the Sabbath],
but shall work on that day; but the Lord's day [as they called Sunday]
they shall especially honor, and, as being Christians, shall, if possible,
do no work on that day. If, however, they be found Judaizing, they
shall be shut out from Christ."&mdash;<i>Hefele, "History of the Councils of the
Church," Vol. II, book 6, sec. 93, canon 29.</i></p></div>


<h4>Fifth Century</h4>

<p>Sozomen's Ecclesiastical History shows Rome evidently
leading in the effort to abolish any recognition whatever of
the Sabbath:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The people of Constantinople, and of several other cities, assemble
together on the Sabbath, as well as on the next day; which custom is
never observed at Rome, or at Alexandria."&mdash;<i>Book 7, chap. 19.</i></p></div>


<h4>Seventh Century</h4>

<p>There were true Sabbath keepers in Rome itself, teaching
the truth of God among the people, and bringing upon
themselves the denunciation of Pope Gregory the Great, who
wrote "to his most beloved sons the Roman citizens:"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It has come to my ears that certain men of perverse spirit have sown
among you some things that are wrong and opposed to the holy faith,
so as to forbid any work being done on the Sabbath day. What else
can I call these but preachers of Antichrist?"&mdash;<i>"History of the Councils"
(Labbe and Cossart), Vol. V, col. 1511; see also "Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers," Vol. XIII, book 13, epistle 1.</i></p></div>


<h4>Eleventh Century</h4>

<p>The Pope's legates at Constantinople (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1054) were
called to discuss with Nicetas, "one of the most learned men
at that time in the East," says Bower, whose position was "that
the Sabbath ought to be kept holy, and that priests should
be allowed to marry."&mdash;<i>"History of the Popes," Vol. II, p. 358.</i></p>

<p>The people of north Scotland, the ancient Culdee church
founded by Columba and his followers, far removed from
direct papal influence, was still keeping the seventh-day Sabbath
in the eleventh century. Of this church Andrew Lang
says in his "History of Scotland:"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They worked on Sunday, but kept Saturday in a Sabbatical manner."&mdash;<i>Volume
I, p. 96.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Skene, in his classic work, "Celtic Scotland," says of these
Sabbath keepers:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They seemed to have followed a custom of which we find traces in
the early monastic church of Ireland, by which they held Saturday to be
the Sabbath, on which they rested from all their labors."&mdash;<i>Book 2, chap.
8.</i></p></div>

<p>Margaret, of England, married Malcolm the Great, the
Scottish king, in 1069. An ardent Catholic, Queen Margaret
at once set about Romanizing the Celtic church. She called
in the church leaders, and held long discussions with them.
At last, with the help and authority of her royal husband, and
quoting the instructions of "the blessed Pope Gregory," she
succeeded in turning the ancient Culdee church in Scotland
away from the Sabbath. (See "Life of St. Margaret," by
Turgot, her confessor.)</p>


<h4>Twelfth to Fourteenth Century</h4>

<p>Among the numerous sects of southern Europe and the
Alpine valleys, that were pursued and persecuted by Rome,
were at least some who saw and obeyed the Sabbath truth.
Thus, of one of these bodies, the historian Goldastus says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They were called Insabbatati, not because they were circumcised,
but because they kept the Sabbath according to the Jewish law."&mdash;<i>"Deutsche
Biographie," Vol. IX, art. "Goldast.," p. 327.</i></p></div>


<h4>Fifteenth Century</h4>

<p>Sabbath keepers in Norway drew the condemnation of a
church council held in 1435:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The archbishop and the clergy assembled in this provincial council
at Bergen do decide that the keeping of Saturday must never be permitted
to exist, except as granted in the church law."&mdash;<i>Keyser's "Norske Kirkes
Historie," Vol. II, p. 488.</i></p></div>


<h4>Sixteenth Century</h4>

<p>With the setting free of the Word of God by the Reformation,
and the protest against the doctrine of papal tradition,
multitudes saw that the Sunday institution was not of divine
origin; while not a few went farther, recognizing the claims
of God's Sabbath. Moravia was a refuge, in those early Reformation days, for
many believers in the Reformed doctrines,
and among these were Sabbath-keeping Christians:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/p176.jpg" width="448" height="269" alt="WALDENSES HUNTED BY THE
ARMIES OF ROME

&quot;Destitute, afflicted, tormented;... they wandered in
deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the
earth.&quot; Heb. 11:37, 38." title="" />
<span class="caption">WALDENSES HUNTED BY THE
ARMIES OF ROME<br />

&quot;Destitute, afflicted, tormented;... they wandered in
deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the
earth.&quot; Heb. 11:37, 38.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Even most prominent men, as the princes of Lichtenstein, held to
the observance of the true Sabbath. When persecution finally scattered
them, the seeds of truth must have been sown by them in the different
portions of the Continent which they visited.... We have found them
[Sabbath keepers] in Bohemia. They were also known in Silesia and
Poland. Likewise they were in Holland and northern Germany....
There were at this time Sabbath keepers in France,... 'among whom
were M. de la Roque, who wrote in defense of the Sabbath against Bossuet,
Catholic bishop of Meaux.' That Sabbatarians again appeared in
England by the time of the Reformation, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1533-1603), Dr. Chambers testifies in his Cyclopedia [art.
'Sabbath']."&mdash;<i>Andrews and Conradi, "History of the Sabbath," pp. 649,
650.</i></p></div>

<p>In this century also, Sabbath keepers appeared in Norway,
Sweden, and Finland. In 1554 King Gustavus Vasa, of
Sweden, addressed a letter of remonstrance "to the common
people in Finland," because so many were turning to keep
the seventh day.</p>


<h4>Seventeenth Century</h4>

<p>There was much discussion in England over the authority
for Sunday observance. When other church festivals were
ignored, as Easter, King Charles I wanted to know why Sunday
should be kept. He wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It will not be found in Scripture where Saturday is discharged to be
kept, or turned into the Sunday; wherefore it must be the church's authority
that changed the one and instituted the other; therefore my opinion
is that those who will not keep this feast [Easter] may as well return
to the observation of Saturday, and refuse the weekly Sunday."&mdash;<i>Cox,
"Sabbath Laws," p. 333.</i></p></div>

<p>It was during this time that the idea first obtained of enforcing
Sunday obligation by the fourth commandment and
calling it the Sabbath. It was argued that any "one day in
seven" was what the commandment meant. Of this argument,
John Milton, the statesman-poet, wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is impossible to extort such a sense from the words of the commandment;
seeing that the reason for which the command itself was
originally given, namely, as a memorial of God's having rested from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
the creation of the world, cannot be transferred from the seventh day to
the first; nor can any new motive be substituted in its place, whether the
resurrection of our Lord or any other, without the sanction of a divine
commandment."&mdash;<i>"Prose Works" (Bohn), pp. 70, 71.</i></p></div>

<p>Again Milton wrote, in a manuscript which his publishers
at the time feared to print:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If we under the gospel are to regulate the time of our public worship
by the prescriptions of the decalogue, it will surely be far safer to observe
the seventh day, according to the express commandment of God, than on
the authority of mere human conjecture to adopt the first."&mdash;<i>Cox, "Sabbath
Literature," Vol. II, p. 54.</i></p></div>

<p>While kings and poets and ecclesiastics discussed, here
and there believers began to follow the plain Word of God
and Christ's example in Sabbath keeping.</p>


<h4>"Loved Not Their Lives unto the Death"</h4>

<p>In 1618 John Traske and his wife, of London, were condemned
for keeping the Sabbath of the Lord, the man being
whipped from Westminster to the old Fleet Prison, near Ludgate
Circus. Both were imprisoned. Mr. Traske recanted
under the pressure, after a year, but Mrs. Traske, a gifted
school-teacher, was given grace to hold out for sixteen years,&mdash;for
a time in Maiden Lane prison, and then in the Gate House,
by Westminster,&mdash;dying in prison for the word of the Lord.
An estimable woman she was, says one old chronicler, save
for this "whimsy" of hers, that she would keep the seventh
day. All that she asked of men, on her prison deathbed,
was that she might be buried "in the fields."</p>

<p>By 1661 Sabbath keepers in London had further increased.
In that year John James was minister to a considerable congregation,
meeting in East London, off the Whitechapel Road.
As part of the stern proceedings against dissenting sects
after the restoration of the monarchy, he was arrested and
condemned to death on "Tyburn Tree." His wife knelt at
the feet of King Charles II as he came out of St. James's
Palace one day, and pleaded for her husband's life; but the
king scornfully rejected her plea, and said that the man should
hang. Bogue says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"For once the king remembered his promise, and Mr. James was
sent to join the noble army of martyrs."&mdash;<i>"History of Dissenters," Vol.
I, p. 155.</i></p></div>

<p>Nothing daunted, the number of Sabbath keepers increased.
In a letter by Edward Stennet (between 1668 and
1670), it is stated.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Here in England are about nine or ten churches that keep the
Sabbath, besides many scattered disciples, who have been eminently
preserved in this tottering day, when many once eminent churches have
been shattered in pieces."&mdash;<i>Cox, "Sabbath Literature," Vol. I, p. 268.</i></p></div>

<p>Francis Bampfield was formerly an influential minister of
the Church of England, and prebendary of Exeter Cathedral,
but later pastor of a Sabbath-keeping congregation meeting
in the Pinners Hall, off Broad Street, near the Bank of England.
Calamy said of him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He was one of the most celebrated preachers in the west of England,
and extremely admired by his hearers, till he fell into the Sabbatarian
notion, of which he was a zealous asserter."&mdash;<i>"Non-Conformist Memorial,"
Vol. II, p. 152.</i></p></div>

<p>He was arrested while in the pulpit preaching, and in 1683
died of hardships in Newgate prison, for the Sabbath of the
Lord. An old writer says that his body was followed to
burial by "a very great company of factious and schismatical
people;" in other words, dissenters from the state church.</p>

<p>Thomas Bampfield, his brother, Speaker of the House of
Parliament at one time, under Cromwell, published a book
in defense of the Sabbath of the Lord. In fact, many published
the truth in this manner, and doctors of divinity and
even bishops wrote replies.</p>

<p>"Sabbatarian Baptists," these English witnesses to God's
Sabbath were first called in those times, and then "Seventh
Day Baptists." In 1664 Stephen Mumford, from one of these
London congregations, was sent over to New England. He
settled in Rhode Island, where the Baptist pioneer of religious
liberty, Roger Williams, had founded his colony. In 1671
the first Sabbatarian church in America was formed in Rhode
Island. Evidently this movement created a stir; for the report<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
went over to England that the Rhode Island colony did
not keep the "Sabbath"&mdash;meaning Sunday. Roger Williams
wrote to his friends in England denying the report, but
calling attention to the fact that there was no Scripture for
"abolishing the seventh day," and adding:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"You know yourselves do not keep the Sabbath, that is the seventh
day."&mdash;<i>"Letters of Roger Williams," Vol. VI, p. 346 (Narragansett Club
Publications).</i></p></div>

<p>Through the following century numbers of Seventh Day
Baptist churches were founded in America.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>Sabbath keepers were springing up also on the continent
of Europe, in Bohemia, Moravia, Transylvania, and Russia,
where here and there Bible believers saw that tradition had
made void one of the commandments of God. Then, as the
events at the end of the long period of papal supremacy had
moved Bible students to the earnest study of the prophecies,
and as the predicted signs of the near approach of Christ's
coming began to appear, there arose the great advent awakening
in the earlier decades of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The prophecies regarding the work of the Papacy in seeking
to change the law of God began to be understood, and it
was seen that the last message of the everlasting gospel was
a call to turn from human traditions to the New Testament
standard&mdash;"the commandments of God, and the faith of
Jesus." Rev. 14:12. Then began the great movement for
Sabbath reform and the proclamation of Christ's second coming,
which has given rise to the Seventh-day Adventist people,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
with a work spreading through all lands, leading thousands
every year to keep the Lord's blessed Sabbath day.</p>

<p>Soon Christ is to be revealed in righteousness and judgment.
One burden of God's message for the last days is:</p>

<p>"Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice:
for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to
be revealed. Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the
son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the Sabbath
from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil."
Isa. 56:1, 2.</p>

<p>Through all the dark centuries, the Lord had somewhere
a little remnant keeping the light of the Sabbath truth glowing.
They, too, overcame by the blood of the Lamb and the
word of their testimony, loving not their lives unto the death.
Now, with the clear light shining from the open Book, it is
for Christians everywhere to turn from tradition to the way
of God's commandments and the example of Jesus Christ.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> In connection with this topic of Sabbath observance in colonial
America,
it is of interest to note that Count Zinzendorf, the leader of the Moravian
missionary movement, was a believer in the sanctity of the Sabbath of God's
appointment. In his life, by Bishop Spangenberg, it is stated that the Sabbath
question was discussed by Zinzendorf with the Moravians, on his visit to
Pennsylvania in 1741. The record states:&mdash;
</p><p>
"As a special circumstance it is to be remarked that he determined, with
the church in Bethlehem, to celebrate the seventh day as a rest day. The matter
was previously fully gone over in the church council, with consideration
of all the reasons for and against it, when the unanimous agreement was
reached to observe the day Sabbatically.... The Count had already long
held the seventh day of the week in special honor."&mdash;<i>Zinzendorfs "Leben,"
band 5, pp. 1421, 1422.</i>
</p><p>
The Bethlehem congregation evidently did not follow the practice long.
"But as for himself," says Spangenberg, "with his house, he adhered firmly
to this aforementioned practice until his end."&mdash;<i>Id., p. 1437.</i></p></div>

<h4>I</h4>

<p>Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or
any likeness of anything: that is in heaven above, or that
is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the
earth: thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve
them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting
the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third
and fourth generation of them that hate me; and showing
mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep
my commandments.</p>

<h4>III</h4>

<p>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in
vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh
his name in vain.</p>

<h4>IV</h4>

<p>Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days
shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day
is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not
do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy
manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy
stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the
Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them
is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed
the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p>

<h4>V</h4>

<p>Honor thy father and thy mother: that thy days may
be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt
not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his
maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is

<h4>THE LAW OF GOD</h4>

<p>It is a common saying, "The majesty of the law." It
means that the character and genius of a government are embodied
and expressed in its laws. The words of Inspiration
declare to us the majesty of the law of the Most High.</p>


<h4>The Character of God's Law</h4>

<p>The infinite perfection of the divine character is reflected
in it.</p>

<p>"The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul."
Ps. 19:7.</p>

<p>As God is holiness and justice and goodness, so also is
His law.</p>

<p>"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy,
and just, and good." Rom. 7:12.</p>


<h4>Its Office</h4>

<p>The law of God gives knowledge of the righteousness
of its great Author.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hearken unto Me, ye that know righteousness, the
people in whose heart is My law." Isa. 51:7.</p>

<p>It marks every departure from righteousness as sin.</p>

<p>"Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law:
for sin is the transgression of the law." 1 John 3:4.</p>

<p>It is not a code merely for the regulation of outward conduct.
It is the moral law&mdash;the primal standard of righteousness
established by the Creator for His creatures. There
is not an impulse of the inmost soul that is not reached by it.
It is the word which, living and powerful, is "sharper than
any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder
of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a
discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." Heb.
4:12.</p>

<p>Face to face with this holy law, we hear in it the voice of
God saying, "Be ye holy; for I am holy." Every soul
must confess its guilt before the searching power of God's
law. All things are naked and open to the eyes of Him with
whom we have to do. "Guilty!" we confess. Left alone
with our guilt, there could be no ray of hope.</p>

</div></div>


<h4>God's Law from the Beginning</h4>

<p>The law of God existed from the beginning. When Adam
sinned, he transgressed this holy law; for "sin is the transgression
of the law." God's law was not committed to writing
until the days of Moses, when the Lord began to make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>His written revelations to the children of men. But from
Adam to Moses the precepts of the law of God were teaching
righteousness and convicting of sin.</p>

<p>"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world,
and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that
all have sinned: (for until the law [the giving of it at Sinai]
sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no
law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses.)"
Rom. 5:12-14.</p>

<p>The declaration of this scripture is: Without the law there
can be no sin. But sin and death were from Adam to Moses,
in whose day the law was spoken on Sinai; therefore the law
of God was in force from the beginning. Its precepts were
witnessed to by every preacher of righteousness raised up by
God in the days before the deluge and in the patriarchal age
following. Of Abraham the Lord says,</p>

<p>"Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My
commandments, My statutes, and My laws." Gen. 26:5.</p>

<p>The Lord called His people out of Egypt, that they might
keep his law. His message to Pharaoh was, "Let my people
go, that they may serve Me." Ex. 9:1. He delivered them
from bondage by His mighty arm, and cleft the Red Sea to
lead them forth to obedience, as the psalmist said,</p>

<p>"He brought forth His people with joy, and His chosen
with gladness:... that they might observe His statutes,
and keep His laws." Ps. 105:43-45.</p>

<p>In Egyptian bondage the children of Abraham must have
lost much of the purity of God's truth; yet the Lord held
them under obligation to know His law&mdash;the Sabbath precept
particularly&mdash;before they came to Sinai, or ever He
had proclaimed the law in their hearing. He tested them in
the matter by the giving of the manna, as He said,</p>

<p>"That I may prove them, whether they will walk in My
law, or no." Ex. 16:4.</p>

<p>From the beginning, God's holy law demanded the loyal
obedience of every human being.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>


<h4>Proclaimed Anew at Sinai</h4>

<p>The Lord had delivered the people of Israel from Egyptian
bondage that they might serve Him and make His ways
known to the nations. This was according to the promise
made to Abraham. To them was committed the written
revelation of God, and through them was to come in the fulness
of time the promised Messiah.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/p186.jpg" width="336" height="347" alt="MOSES BREAKING THE TABLES
OF THE LAW

&quot;He wrote them upon two tables of
stone.&quot; Deut. 4:13." title="" />
<span class="caption">MOSES BREAKING THE TABLES
OF THE LAW<br />

&quot;He wrote them upon two tables of
stone.&quot; Deut. 4:13.</span>
</div>

<p>While the Lord at this time "made known His ways unto
Moses," and there was begun the written revelation which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
grew into "the volume of the book," the Holy Scriptures,
one portion of revelation was not left for the prophet of God
to speak or for the inspired pen to write. The Lord proclaimed
His holy law with His own voice, and gave to men a
copy "written with the finger of God." Moses said of this:</p>

<p>"The Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire:
ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only
ye heard a voice. And He declared unto you His covenant,
which He commanded you to perform, even ten commandments;
and He wrote them upon two tables of stone." Deut.
4:12, 13.</p>

<p>This display of majesty and glory indescribable was designed
to teach how sacred and holy is the law, and to cause
men to fear to transgress its precepts. Ex. 20:20.</p>

<p>It was not for themselves alone that the law was committed
to Israel. They were to teach the truth to others.
As the New Testament says, it was greatly to their advantage
that "unto them were committed the oracles of God."
Rom. 3:2. But they "received the lively oracles to give
unto us." Through obedience to the divine law, they were
to be a light to the nations.</p>

<p>"Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom
and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which
shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation
is a wise and understanding people. For what nation
is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them?" Deut.
4:6, 7.</p>

<p>An interesting comment upon these words is supplied by
a speech of Phalerius, librarian to Ptolemy Philadelphus, king
of Egypt. Urging the king by all means to secure copies of
the sacred books of the Jews for his great library in Alexandria,
Phalerius said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Now it is necessary that thou shouldst have accurate copies of them.
And indeed this legislation is full of hidden wisdom, and entirely blameless,
as being the legislation of God; for which cause it is, as Hecateus
of Abdera says, that the poets and historians make no mention of it, nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of those men who lead their lives according to it, since it is a holy law, and
ought not to be published by profane mouths."&mdash;<i>Josephus, "Antiquities,"
book 12, chap. 2, sec. 4.</i></p></div>

<p>Unfaithful as the Jewish people oftentimes were, yet
through their testimony and the dealings of God with them,
the fame of the living oracles was spread abroad among the
ancient nations.</p>


<h4>One God&mdash;One Moral Standard</h4>

<p>"There is one Lawgiver." James 4:12. He is ever the
same, and His law is the standard of righteousness for all
mankind. There was not one moral standard before Christ
and another after. Christ's death upon the cross because
man had broken the law, is the divine testimony to all the
universe that God's law can never be set aside nor its force
suspended. Jesus opened His public teaching with the declaration:</p>

<p>"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the
prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily
I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one
tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,
and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in
the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach
them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
Matt. 5:17-19.</p>

<p>The moral law of ten commandments is one code, every
precept equally sacred and equally binding:</p>

<p>"Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in
one point, he is guilty of all. For He that said, Do not commit
adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no
adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of
the law. So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged
by the law of liberty." James 2:10-12.</p>

<p>The law of God still speaks with all the force of that voice
from Sinai, and it speaks to every soul on earth:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now we know that what things soever the law saith,
it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth
may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before
God." Rom. 3:19.</p>

<p>Thus the law of God convicts all men of sin, and would
drive every one to Christ for pardon and for the divine gift of
the grace and power of obedience.</p>

<p>The ceremonial law&mdash;the precepts and ordinances commanded
for the sacrificial system&mdash;ceased with the sacrifice
of Calvary, as all these ceremonial observances pointed forward
to the cross. There can be no confounding of the moral
law and the ceremonial law. The ceremonial law of types
and shadows showed in itself that a primary or higher law&mdash;the
moral law&mdash;had been violated, making necessary a divine
sacrifice if transgressors were to be saved from death and restored
to obedience.</p>


<h4>The Standard in the Judgment</h4>

<p>The law of God's moral government, which is the rule of
life for every creature, must necessarily be the standard in
the great judgment day. The Scripture states the sum of all
human obligation and responsibility in the words:</p>

<p>"Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear
God, and keep His commandments: for this is the whole duty
of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment,
with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be
evil." Eccl. 12:13, 14.</p>

<p>Every son and daughter of Adam's lost race is judgment
bound, to answer before the bar of God the demands of the
perfect law. Divine justice cannot abate one jot or tittle
of the requirements of the holy law, nor by any means clear
the guilty. But divine mercy has provided the way by which
God can "be just, and the justifier of him which believeth
in Jesus."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="JUSTIFICATION_BY_FAITH" id="JUSTIFICATION_BY_FAITH"></a>JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH</h2>


<p>"How should man be just [righteous] with God?" asked
the patriarch Job. It has been the vital question ever since
Adam sinned, and lost his righteousness and forfeited his
life. The answer of Scripture is:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with
God through our Lord Jesus Christ." Rom 5:1 "By
grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves:
it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man
should boast." Eph. 2:8, 9.</p>

<p>In the beginning, life and righteousness were the gift of
God to man. Only the Creator could bestow the gift at the
first; when lost, only creative power can restore it.</p>


<h4>Man Cannot Justify Himself</h4>

<p>The law of God declares all men sinners. Not only did
Adam's posterity inherit of necessity a sinful nature, but
every soul of man has wrought sin as the fruit of that nature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"As by one man sin entered into the world, and death
by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
sinned." Rom. 5:12.</p>

<p>"There is no difference," Jew or Gentile, bond or free,
they are in the same lost condition; "for all have sinned, and
come short of the glory of God." Rom. 10:12; 3:23.</p>

<p>The sinner finds himself a transgressor, condemned to
death by a holy law. He turns to it with the thought, "I
will do what it says, and become righteous and win life."
But he cannot undo the fact that he has sinned. A holy law
can only cry, "Guilty! guilty!" to one who has transgressed
it. The law declares righteousness; it cannot give it. As
the Scripture says:</p>

<p>"We know that what things soever the law saith, it saith
to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be
stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified
in His sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin."
Rom. 3:19, 20.</p>

<p>The guilt exists. No deeds that man can do can undo it
or cover it from a righteous law. Not only that, but as soon
as the law declares what righteousness is, the sinner finds
that its demands are altogether beyond the power of his flesh
to meet. It calls for a kind of work that fallen human nature
cannot so much as approach. Paul cried out, when struggling
under conviction, "We know that the law is spiritual:
but I am carnal, sold under sin." Rom. 7:14.</p>

<p>The carnal cannot bring forth the spiritual. But the law
demands a spiritual work of righteousness. It is impossible
for the carnal mind to undertake it. The Scripture says:</p>

<p>"The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not
subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then
they that are in the flesh cannot please God." Rom. 8:7, 8.</p>

<p>But the awakened sinner is yet in the flesh. He finds the
law thundering his guilt and condemning him to death. He
cannot wash away the past, nor hide it; he cannot obey God's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
law with a carnal mind, and that is all the mind he has. He
is lost, and helpless of himself, but longs for a way of escape.
Paul's cry in the same position is the cry of the despairing
heart that has not found the Saviour, "O wretched man that
I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"
Rom. 7:24. Thank God, there is an answer to that cry, for
every sinner.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Plunged in a gulf of dark despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We wretched sinners lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without one cheering beam of hope,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">He came to our relief."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>The Free Gift of Christ</h4>

<p>Following that despairing cry of human helplessness, "Who
shall deliver me?" there came the believer's shout of praise,
"I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord." He is the
deliverer; for He "gave Himself for our sins, that He might
deliver us." Rom. 7:25; Gal. 1:4.</p>

<p>The way of escape and salvation is the gift of God's love.
"God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but
have everlasting life." John 3:16.</p>

<p>No sinner has need to plead that God may be willing to
forgive him; the Lord's infinite love that gave His Son to die,
is pleading with the sinner to believe and accept salvation.</p>

<p>In order to be the sinner's Saviour, the divine Son of God
must take man's place before the broken law. He came in
human flesh, with all its weakness. "I can of Mine own
self," He said, "do nothing." He trusted the Father, and
lived a life of perfect righteousness in human flesh. He who
knew no sin, bore man's sin in His body on the cross. "The
Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all." For man's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
sin He died, "that He by the grace of God should taste death
for every man." In Him was met the penalty of the law.
But it was a sinless sacrifice. He "through the eternal Spirit
offered Himself without spot to God." Heb. 9:14. Therefore
death could not hold Him. He rose in the power of an
endless life to be man's advocate and priest and savior,
ministering His grace and righteousness and life to every one
who will receive them.</p>

<p>The righteousness that He wrought out for man in human
flesh He longs to put into every human heart. As in
His own flesh in Judea He walked and lived the life of righteousness,
so now, by the Holy Spirit, He walks in human lives
today. That means forgiveness, and deliverance from the
power of the flesh, and a new life of power, and righteousness
and justification wrought within by the divine indwelling
Saviour. How may we receive Him with all this great salvation?&mdash;By
faith; by believing His promises; "that Christ
may dwell in your hearts by faith." Eph. 3:17.</p>

<p>Christ in all His fulness abiding within,&mdash;this is the wonder
and mystery of the gospel, "which is Christ in you, the
hope of glory." It means an ever-present, ever-living Saviour,
able to save to the uttermost.</p>

<p>What abundance of grace is received with His indwelling
presence!</p>

<p><i>Forgiveness.</i>&mdash;"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and
just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
1 John 1:9.</p>

<p><i>Deliverance from the Flesh.</i>&mdash;The cleansing by Christ's indwelling
power means that the old life of self is subdued.
"Our old man is crucified with Him." Rom. 6:6. "Ye are
not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God
dwell in you.... And if Christ be in you, the body is dead
because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness."
Rom. 8:9, 10.</p>

<p><i>A New Heart.</i>&mdash;"A new heart also will I give you, and a
new spirit will I put within you." Eze. 36:26.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A New Life.</i>&mdash;"Be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created
in righteousness and true holiness." Eph. 4:23, 24. It is in
blessed fact Christ Jesus living the life in the believer by
faith, as the apostle Paul says:</p>

<p>"I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not
I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the
flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and
gave Himself for me." Gal. 2:20.</p>

<p><i>Righteousness and Justification.</i>&mdash;"This is His name
whereby He shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS."
Jer. 23:6. Well does the King James Version print
the blessed name in capital letters. It is the great name of
salvation to every believer. By faith we receive Him, and by
faith His righteousness is imputed unto us. His life of obedience
covers all the believer's surrendered life, past and continuous,
and in God's sight the life of the believer in Jesus is
justified from all sin. It is the triumph of Him who was not
only "delivered for our offenses," but was also "raised again
for our justification:"</p>

<p>"Therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon
all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one
the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. For
as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by
the obedience of one shall many be made righteous." Rom.
5:18, 19.</p>

<p>Christ died and rose again to bring this experience to sinners
who have struggled helplessly under condemnation. As
Christ Jesus with all His righteousness is received by faith,
"there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are
in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
Spirit." Rom. 8:1.</p>

<p>Praise the Lord! It is all of Christ, and not of any works
that we have done. Therefore it is as sure as the oath and
promise of God. We can lose the experience only as we let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Christ go out of the life by unbelief. God forbid that we
should do this; and help us to be quick to repent and again
lay hold of Him by faith if ever we find we have let Him go
and have lost the covering of His righteousness.</p>

</div>

<p>Christ's righteousness is, of necessity, the righteousness
demanded by the law of God. He lives that law in the believer.
This is what justification is. "Not the hearers of
the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall
be justified." Rom. 2:13. Justification by faith makes the
man a doer of the law by faith, Christ living every one of its
sacred precepts in the believer's life. This is what He died
to accomplish, to bring the righteousness of the law to the
sinner who could never attain to it himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"What the law could not do, in that it was weak through
the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful
flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness
of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not
after the flesh, but after the Spirit." Rom. 8:3, 4.</p>

<p>Christ writes God's law in the new heart: "I will put
My laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts."
Heb. 8:10. It is the rule of His own righteousness. For
before He came into the world to work out perfect righteousness
for us in human flesh, He said, through the psalmist,
"I delight to do Thy will, O My God: yea, Thy law is within
My heart." Ps. 40:8.</p>

<p>It is a perfect righteousness and a full salvation that Christ
brings into every believer's heart. In Him all fulness dwells,
"and ye are complete in Him."</p>

<p>The wondrous plan of salvation is so deep that only "in
the ages to come" will God be able to "show the exceeding
riches of His grace in His kindness toward us through Christ
Jesus." Eph. 2:7. But thank God, even here below sinners
saved by grace may "know the love of Christ, which passeth
knowledge."</p>

<h2><a name="BAPTISM" id="BAPTISM"></a>BAPTISM</h2>

<h3>THE MEMORIAL OF THE RESURRECTION</h3>


<p>Baptism is the divinely appointed memorial of the resurrection
of Christ. The great fact of the gospel is that "Christ
died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He
was buried, and that He rose again the third day according
to the Scriptures" (1 Cor. 15:3, 4), to be our great High
Priest and Saviour.</p>

<p>Baptism is a profession of faith in the Saviour, who went
into the grave for us, and rose again to life. It is the great
object-lesson to teach the truth that the sinner must die to
sin and the world, and have a resurrection by the power of
divine grace to a new life of obedience. The ordinance is the
sign of an actual experience, the means by which the believer
confesses the work of grace in the soul.</p>

<p>The Scriptures teach the essential conditions necessary
to baptism:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved."
Mark 16:15, 16.</p>

<p>"What doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip said,
If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest." Acts
8:36, 37.</p>

<p>"Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized
every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission
of sins." Acts 2:38.</p>

<p>Thus it is seen that instruction in the gospel, belief in
Christ, and repentance are conditions to precede baptism.</p>


<h4>Baptism for Believers</h4>

<p>The experience of which baptism is the sign is thus
stated:</p>

<p>"We are buried with Him by baptism into death: that
like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of
the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
Rom. 6:4.</p>

<p>"As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have
put on Christ." Gal. 3:27.</p>

<p>"Buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen
with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who
hath raised Him from the dead." Col. 2:12.</p>

<p>In this ordinance, commanded of God, the believer is following
the example of Christ, who, when baptized by John in
Jordan, said, "Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thus through the emblematic grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glorious suffering Saviour trod;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art our Pattern, through the wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We follow Thee, blest Son of God."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>The Form of Baptism</h4>

<p>The Scriptural form of baptism is shown in these texts:</p>

<p>"Jesus, when He was baptized, went up straightway out
of the water." Matt. 3:16.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"They went down both into the water, both Philip and
the eunuch; and he baptized him." Acts 8:38.</p>

<p>"Buried with Him by baptism.... For if we have been
planted together in the likeness of His death, we shall be also
in the likeness of His resurrection." Rom. 6:4, 5.</p>

<p>While the outward form of a religious service, without
the spirit and the experience which the form professes, must
ever be unacceptable to God, yet when the Lord prescribes
a form, it is imperative that His instruction should be followed.
The form of the ordinance as commanded by God
emphasizes the divine meaning of the service.</p>

<p>Scriptural baptism is a burial "in the likeness" of Christ's
burial, as the lifting up of the believer from the watery grave
is a likeness of the resurrection of Christ. Of the meaning
of the word "baptism," Luther wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Baptism is a Greek word; in Latin it can be translated immersion,
as when we plunge something into water that it may be completely covered
with water."&mdash;<i>Opera Lutheri, De Sac. Bap. 1, p. 319 (Baptist Encyclopedia,
art. "Baptism").</i></p></div>

<p>Calvin, after arguing that the form is an indifferent matter,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The very word 'baptize,' however, signifies to immerse; and it is
certain that immersion was observed by the ancient church."&mdash;<i>"Institutes,"
lib. 4, cap. 15 (Baptist Encyclopedia, art. "Baptism").</i></p></div>

<p>Of the practice in primitive times, Neander, the church
historian, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In respect to the manner of baptizing, in conformity with the original
institution and the original import of the symbol, it was generally
administered by immersion."&mdash;<i>"History of the Christian Church," Torrey's
translation (London edition), Vol. I, p. 429.</i></p></div>

<p>The perversion of the ordinance into sprinkling, and that
in infancy, takes away the divinely ordained object-lesson;
and in the case of the infant must of necessity substitute
mere ceremonialism for experience, for the child of unaccountable
years can have had no experience of believing and
repenting, which are the necessary conditions to fulfil the
meaning of baptism. The change in the ordinance, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
most of the changes that came about in the days of the "falling
away" from the primitive faith and practice, was by
gradual process.</p>

<p>Dean Stanley, in his "Christian Institutions," page 24,
says that it is not till the third century that "we find one
case of the baptism of infants." Of the change from immersion
to sprinkling, he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"What is the justification of this almost universal departure from the
primitive usage? There may have been many reasons, some bad, some
good. One, no doubt, was the superstitious feeling already mentioned
which regarded baptism as a charm, indispensable to salvation, and which
insisted on imparting it to every human being who could be touched with
water, however unconscious."</p></div>

<p>The common practice as late as the twelfth century is thus
described by a Roman Catholic cardinal of that time, named
Pullus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Whilst the candidate for baptism in water is immersed, the death
of Christ is suggested; whilst immersed and covered with water, the burial
of Christ is shown forth; whilst he is raised from the waters, the resurrection
of Christ is proclaimed."&mdash;<i>Patrol. Lat., Vol. CXXX, p. 315 (Baptist
Encyclopedia, art. "Baptism").</i></p></div>

<p>Dean Stanley, of Westminster, one of the first scholars
of the Church of England, wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"For the first thirteen centuries the almost universal practice of baptism
was that of which we read in the New Testament, and which is the
very meaning of the word 'baptize,'&mdash;that those who were baptized
were plunged, submerged, immersed into the water. That practice is
still, as we have seen, continued in Eastern churches. In the Western
church it still lingers among Roman Catholics in the solitary instance
of the Cathedral of Milan; among Protestants in the numerous sects of
the Baptists. It lasted long into the Middle Ages.... But since the
beginning of the seventeenth century, the practice has become exceedingly
rare. With the few exceptions just mentioned, the whole of the Western
churches have now substituted for the ancient bath the ceremony of letting
fall a few drops of water on the face. The reason of the change is
obvious. The practice of immersion, though peculiarly suitable to the
Southern and Eastern countries for which it was designed, was not found
seasonable in the countries of the North and West. Not by any decree
of council or parliament, but by the general sentiment of Christian liberty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
this remarkable change was effected. Beginning in the thirteenth century,
it has gradually driven the ancient catholic usage out of the whole
of Europe."&mdash;<i>"Christian Institutions," pp. 21, 22.</i></p></div>

<p>The facts are undeniable, and emphasize the importance
of reformation and return in practice to the plain instructions
of the Word of God. As the record shows, it was not the
spirit of the New Testament church that made this change
in the divine ordinance; rather it is the spirit of the church
of the "falling away," against which the Lord warns all believers,
"because they have transgressed the laws, changed the
ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PROPHECY_OF_DANIEL_8" id="THE_PROPHECY_OF_DANIEL_8"></a>THE PROPHECY OF DANIEL 8</h2>

<h3>A HISTORIC OUTLINE AND A VITAL QUESTION</h3>


<p>Another view of the history of empires and kingdoms
was brought before the prophet Daniel in the vision of the
eighth chapter. In this vision a great prophetic period is
given, the end of which reaches to the latter days, touching
events of our own times that are of direct interest and importance
to every one today.</p>

<p>The vision was given in the third year of Belshazzar, the
last king of Babylon. Again, as in moving panorama, there
passed before the prophet's vision the scenes of history.
Earthly kingdoms were represented under the symbols of
beasts.</p>

<p>We shall find the prophecy and the history corresponding
in every detail, revealing the overruling hand of God, who
knows the end from the beginning, and whose living Word of
truth bears its witness through all the ages.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Truth never dies. The ages come and go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountains wear away; the seas retire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destruction lays earth's mighty cities low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And empires, states, and dynasties expire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But caught and handed onward by the wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Truth never dies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The opening scene of this vision, given by the river Ulai,
in Persia, is thus described:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prophecy.</i>&mdash;"Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and,
behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two
horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than
the other, and the higher came up last. I saw the ram pushing
westward, and northward, and southward; so that no
beast might stand before him, neither was there any that
could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his
will, and became great." Verses 3, 4.</p>

<p>In the angel's interpretation of the vision Daniel was told:
"The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings
of Media and Persia." Verse 20. "The higher came up
last."</p>

<p>The two horns represented the dual character of the empire:
first the Medes in ascendancy, then the Persians rising
to yet greater power. "So that no beast might stand before
him," says the prophecy.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Xenophon says of Cyrus the Persian:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He was able to extend the fear of himself over so great a part of the
world that he astonished all, and no one attempted anything against
him."&mdash;<i>"The Cyrop&aelig;dia," book 1, chap. 1.</i></p></div>

<p>The line of Medo-Persian conquest was "westward, and
northward, and southward," just as the prophet saw the ram
pushing its way. As one pen wrote in the days of Persia's
supremacy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He [Darius] showed the world arms glory-crowned."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Towns untold before him fell."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Burgs over sea ... heard from his lips their fate."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>"The Persians," by &AElig;schylus.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the ram pushing westward stirred up an antagonist
that was eventually to overcome him. The prophet continues:</p>

<p><i>Prophecy.</i>&mdash;"As I was considering, behold, a he goat came
from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not
the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.
And he came to the ram that had two horns,... and ran<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
unto him in the fury of his power.... And there was no
power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down
to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none
that could deliver the ram out of his hand." Verses 5-7.</p>

<p>The angel's interpretation continued: "The rough goat is
the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his
eyes is the first king." Verse 21.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;This "first king" of united Grecia was Alexander
the Great.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"With Alexander the New Greece begins."&mdash;<i>Harrison, "Story of
Greece," p. 499.</i></p>

<p>"And it happened, after that Alexander ... had smitten Darius
king of the Persians and Medes, that he reigned in his stead, the first
over Greece." 1 Maccabees 1:1.</p></div>

<p>Under Alexander, the Grecian goat ran upon the Persian
ram "in the fury of his power." At Arbela, wrote Arrian, the
Macedonians charged "with great fury." None was able to
deliver the Persian ram. "Wherever you fly," wrote Alexander
to the retreating Darius, "thither I will surely pursue
you." (See "Anabasis of Alexander the Great," by Arrian,
book 2, chap. 14.) Medo-Persia fell before Grecia, as this
sure word of prophecy had foretold two hundred years before
Alexander's day.</p>

<p>Grecia's expansion and its later history were next unfolded
before the prophet's vision:</p>

<p><i>Prophecy.</i>&mdash;"Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and
when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it
came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven."
Verse 8.</p>

<p>Of the ram (Persia) it was said it became "great;" of the
goat (Grecia); that it became "very great."</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Justin, the Roman, wrote of Alexander:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"So much was the whole world awed by the terror of his name, that
all nations came to pay their obedience to him."&mdash;<i>"History of the World,"
book 12, chap. 13.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>But the unerring prophecy had said that "when he was
strong, the great horn was broken." Suddenly the youthful
conqueror was cut down by death, just as he was preparing to
celebrate at Babylon a "convention of the whole universe,"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"being thus taken off in the flower of his age, and in the height of his
victories."&mdash;<i>Justin, "History of the World," book 13, chap. 1.</i></p></div>

<p>The ancient pagan writers, in telling the story, make use
of language very similar to that used by divine prophecy in
foretelling it. Following Alexander's death the empire was
divided "toward the four winds of heaven." Myers says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Four well-defined and important monarchies arose out of the
ruins.... The great horn was broken; and instead of it came up four
notable ones toward the four winds of heaven."&mdash;<i>"History of Greece"
(edition 1902), p. 457.</i></p></div>

<p>As the prophet watched these four kingdoms of divided
Greece, he beheld another power coming into the field of his
vision through one of the four kingdoms, and extending its
authority more than any before it:</p>

<p><i>Prophecy.</i>&mdash;"Out of one of them [one of the four kingdoms]
came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great,
toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant
land." Verse 9.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Medo-Persia was "great," Grecia was "very
great," but this power was to be "exceeding great." Rome
followed Grecia. Polybius, the Roman, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Almost the whole inhabited world was conquered, and brought under
the dominion of the single city of Rome."&mdash;<i>"Histories of Polybius" (Evelyn
Shuckburgh's translation), book 1, chap. 1.</i></p></div>

<p>One of the odes of Horace tells how the name of Rome
grew to might:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Till her superb dominion spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">East, where the sun comes forth in light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And west to where he lays his head."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>Ode 15, "To Augustus," book 4.</i><br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Lucan's lines measured its exceeding greatness from the
other points of the compass:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Though from the frozen pole our empire run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far as the journeys of the southern sun."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>"Pharsalia," book 10.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The empire of the Romans filled the world," says Gibbon.
It was "exceeding great," according to the prophecy.
In the vision the little horn that grew so great came into the
prophet's view as proceeding out of one of the four horns that
he had been watching. Rome rose to unquestioned supremacy
out of its conquest of Macedonia, one of the four notable
kingdoms into which Grecia was divided. It spread forth
toward the south, and toward the east, and "toward the
pleasant land," Palestine becoming a province of the empire
in the century before Christ. And it was a Roman force that
destroyed Jerusalem and devastated the pleasant land.</p>

<p>Thus the "sure word of prophecy," with exactness in
detail, carries the history through the centuries to the last
great universal monarchy, Rome.</p>

<p>But this prophecy does not deal so much with the earlier
history of Rome as with the developments of later times. It
was the same in the prophetic outline of Daniel 7. After
briefly identifying Rome as the last universal monarchy, the
vision of the seventh chapter dealt with the rise of papal Rome,
described its exaltation of itself against God, and its warfare
against the truth and the saints of God. And here again,
in the eighth chapter, the same persecuting power is seen developing,
exalting itself, and persecuting the saints of God.
The prophecy says that "it cast down the truth to the ground;
and it practiced, and prospered." Dan. 8:12. The papal history,
as given in the study on Daniel 7, need not be repeated
here.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>As the prophet watched the work of this lawless power,
his heart must have cried out to know how long it was to be
allowed to prosper in its evil way; for next he heard the voice
of a holy one asking the question for him,</p>

<p>"How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice,
and the transgression of desolation, to give both the
sanctuary and the host to be trodden underfoot?" Dan. 8:13.</p>

<p>The answer was,</p>

<p>"Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall
the sanctuary be cleansed." Verse 14.</p>

<p>In symbolic prophecy a day stands for a year. Eze. 4:6.
This is a long period, therefore, of 2300 years. It reaches to
the latter days; for the angel said of it, "At the time of the
end shall be the vision." Dan. 8:17.</p>

<p>The question was, "How long?" or literally, "Until when?"
and the answer was, "Until two thousand and three hundred
days." Then what was to come to deal with the great apostasy?&mdash;"Then
shall the sanctuary be cleansed." The cleansing
of the sanctuary, therefore, must have something to do
with meeting the great apostasy, lifting up God's truth that
has been trampled underfoot, and cutting short the reign of
evil. The cleansing of the sanctuary, with all that is involved
in it, must be God's answer to this lawless power.</p>

<p>Error may prosper for a time; but the just balances of
the sanctuary will at last pronounce righteous judgment, and
the prosperity of evil will be cut short. "I was envious ...
when I saw the prosperity of the wicked," said the psalmist,
"until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood
I their end." Ps. 73:3, 17.</p>

<p>What, then, is involved in the cleansing of the sanctuary,
the time of which is marked by the long prophetic period?
It is for us to understand; for it is a work pertaining to the
latter days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE CLEANSING OF THE SANCTUARY IN TYPE AND ANTITYPE</h2>


<p>The Bible teaching concerning the sanctuary of the Levitical
service shows clearly that the cleansing of the sanctuary
is God's answer to error and apostasy.</p>

<p>The priestly service of the earthly sanctuary, or temple,
in the days of Israel, was typical of the work of Christ, our
High Priest, in the heavenly temple. The earthly priests
served after "the example and shadow of heavenly things."
Heb. 8:5. And of Christ's ministry in the heavenly temple
we are told:</p>

<p>"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum:
We have such a high priest, who is set on the right hand of
the throne of the Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the
sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched,
and not man." Heb. 8:1, 2.</p>

<p>In the earthly service, the cleansing of the sanctuary was
the closing work of the high priest, marking the end of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
yearly round of mediatory ministry. The cleansing of the
sanctuary in the time of the end must, therefore, according
to the sure teaching of the type, be the closing ministry of
our great High Priest in the heavenly temple, before He lays
aside His priestly work to come in glory.</p>


<h4>The Service of the Earthly Tabernacle</h4>

<p>There were two distinct phases in the priestly ministry
of the tabernacle in Israel. The sanctuary was built with
two apartments, the holy place and the most holy.</p>

<p>In the holy place were the candlestick with its seven lights,
the table with its ever-renewed "bread of the presence," and
the altar of incense, on which sweet incense, symbol of Christ's
continual intercession, was burned morning and night.</p>

<p>Within the inner veil was the most holy place, where was
the ark containing the tables of the law, written with the
finger of God. The cover of the ark was the golden mercy-seat,
above which, at either end, stood two cherubim of gold,
their wings meeting on high, their faces looking ever toward
the mercy-seat. It was a type of the throne of God&mdash;the
angels about the throne, the law the foundation of His government,
the mercy-seat typifying the interposition of mercy
and pardon for the sinner; and above it the visible glory of
the Lord, the Shekinah.</p>

<p>"There I will meet with thee, and I will commune with
thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim
which are upon the ark of the testimony." Ex. 25:22.</p>

<p>Of the service in the first apartment it is stated:</p>

<p>"When these things were thus ordained, the priests went
always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of
God." Heb. 9:6.</p>

<p>"Day by day the sacrificial victims were slain at the altar
before the outer veil, and the blood was 'brought into the
sanctuary' by the priest." This was an acknowledgment
of transgression of God's law, meriting death, and a confession
of faith in the Lamb of God who was to suffer death in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
the sinner's stead, and whose atoning blood would plead for
him before the righteous law.</p>

<p>Thus day by day, either by the sprinkling of the blood
"before the Lord" or by eating a portion of the flesh of the
burnt offering in the holy place, the ministry of the priests
transferred the sin in type to the sanctuary, and the sinner
was pardoned.</p>

<p>For a full year, lacking one day, the ministry was in the
first apartment, or holy place only. But on that last day
of the yearly round of service&mdash;"the tenth day of the seventh
month"&mdash;the high priest entered the second apartment, or
most holy place.</p>

<p>"Into the second went the high priest alone once every
year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for
the errors of the people." Heb. 9:7.</p>

<p>In this service the high priest sprinkled the blood upon
the mercy-seat and in the holy place, "because of the uncleanness
of the children of Israel." The sanctuary was to
be reconciled or cleansed from all the sins registered there
in type through the blood of the offerings brought day by
day during the year.</p>

<p>As the high priest came out, bearing the sins, he transferred
them all to the head of the scapegoat, which was sent
away into the wilderness; and thus "all their iniquities"
were borne away from the camp into the wilderness, and the
sanctuary was cleansed. See Leviticus 16.</p>

<p>This was a solemn time of judgment in Israel. Every
man's life came in review that day. Was every sin confessed?
Whosoever was not found right with God, when that service
was performed, was cut off from having a part with God's
people.</p>

<p>"It is a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you
before the Lord your God. For whatsoever soul it be that
shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off
from among his people." Lev. 23:28, 29.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>It was indeed an annual day of judgment in Israel. And
all this was an "example and shadow of heavenly things."
Heb. 8:5.</p>


<h4>Christ's Closing Work in Heaven</h4>

<p>Therefore the last phase of Christ's ministry as our high
priest in the sanctuary of God above, must be a work of judgment,
a review of the heavenly record, corresponding to the
final ministry in the second apartment of the earthly tabernacle,
when that sanctuary was cleansed.</p>

&quot;As often as ye eat this bread, and drink
this cup, ye do show the Lord&#39;s death
till He come.&quot; 1 Cor. 11:26.</span>
</div>

<p>Daniel the prophet was shown in vision this change in
the ministry of our High Priest, namely, from the first to
the second apartment of the heavenly temple. He describes
the wondrous scene, as God's living throne, with its wheels
flaming with glory, moved into the most holy place of the
heavenly sanctuary, for the closing work of Christ's ministry:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beheld till the thrones were cast down ["placed,"
R.V.], and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was
white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure wool:
His throne was like the fiery flame, and His wheels as burning
fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him:
thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand
times ten thousand stood before Him: the judgment was set,
and the books were opened." Dan. 7:9, 10.</p>

<p>This scene, as the next verse shows, opens while still on
earth the apostasy is exalting itself. But during this same
time a solemn judgment work is going forward in heaven
above, the finishing of which will give God's answer to the
apostasy, and bring the second coming of Christ in glory to
end the reign of sin. It is the cleansing of the sanctuary,&mdash;the
time when in reality and not in type every case registered
in the sanctuary comes in final review before God. When
that work closes, according to the type, whosoever is not
found right with God will be cut off from having any part
with His redeemed people.</p>

<p>Then the priestly ministry of Christ will close, and the
destiny of every soul will be fixed for all eternity. To that
time must apply the words spoken by Jesus:</p>

<p>"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: ... and he
that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is
holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly."
Rev. 22:11, 12.</p>

<p>But now the Saviour, from His place of ministry on high,
speaks to all the encouraging exhortation and assurance:</p>

<p>"He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white
raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of
life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and before
His angels." Rev. 3:5.</p>

<p>To let men on earth know when this judgment work, the
cleansing of the sanctuary, began in heaven, the prophetic
period of 2300 years was given. It is of most solemn importance
that we know when that period begins and ends.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="A_GREAT_PROPHETIC_PERIOD" id="A_GREAT_PROPHETIC_PERIOD"></a>A GREAT PROPHETIC PERIOD</h2>


<h3>THE 2300 YEARS OF DANIEL 8:14</h3>

<p>The commission to the angel Gabriel was, "Make this
man to understand the vision" (Dan. 8:16); therefore in the
angel's explanation of the vision of Daniel 8, we must assuredly
find the interpretation of the prophetic period of 2300
years, the close of which marks the opening of the judgment
work in heaven, or the cleansing of the sanctuary.</p>

<p>The eighth chapter closes, however, with no reference to
the beginning of this period of time, a most important measuring
line of prophecy. The angel had explained the symbols
representing Medo-Persia, Grecia, and Rome, and had dwelt
upon the antichristian work of the apostasy that was to develop;
but he left the time of the prophetic period unexplained,
save to say that it was "true," and that it would
be "for many days"&mdash;far in the future. Here the angel
stopped, for Daniel fainted. In spirit the prophet had been
gazing upon the warfare of the great apostasy against God's
truth through the ages, and evidently it took all strength
from him. Daniel closes the account of this vision with the
words, "I was astonished at the vision, but none understood
it." Verse 27.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/p220.jpg" width="448" height="133" alt="THE 2300 DAYS" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE 2300 DAYS</span>
</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The heavy line represents the full 2300 year-day period, the longest prophetic
period in the Bible. Beginning in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 457
when the decree was given to restore and build Jerusalem (Ezra 7:11-26; Dan.
9:25), seven weeks (49 years) are measured off
to indicate the time occupied in this work of restoration. These, however, are a
part of the sixty-nine weeks (483 years) that
were to reach to Messiah, the Anointed One. Christ was anointed in 27
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, at His baptism. Matt. 3:13-17; Acts 10:38.
In the midst of the seventieth week (31 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>), Christ was crucified or
"cut off," which marked the time when the sacrifices and
oblations of the earthly sanctuary were to cease. Dan. 9:25, 27. The remaining
three and one-half years of this week reach
to 34 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, or to the stoning of Stephen, and the great persecution of
the church at Jerusalem which followed. Acts 7:59;
8:1. This marked the close of the seventy weeks, or 490 years, allotted to the
Jewish people.</p></div>

<p>But the seventy weeks are a part of the 2300 days; and as they (the seventy
weeks) reach to 34 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, the remaining
1810 years of the 2300-day period must reach to 1844, when the work of judgment,
or cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary,
was to begin. Rev. 14:6, 7. Then special light began to shine upon the whole
sanctuary subject, and Christ's mediatorial
or priestly work in it.</p>

<p>Four great events, therefore, are located by this great prophetic period,&mdash;the
first advent, the crucifixion, the rejection of
the Jewish people as a nation, and the beginning of the work of final judgment.]<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>But the angel had been commanded, "Make this man to
understand the vision;" and soon after, as recorded in the
next chapter,&mdash;possibly within a year,<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>&mdash;Gabriel appeared
to the prophet with the words:</p>

<p>"O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and
understanding.... Therefore understand the matter, and
consider the vision." Dan. 9:22, 23.</p>

<p>Thereupon the angel began to deal with the matter of
time in the prophecy, the very feature of the vision of the
eighth chapter that he had not yet made Daniel understand.
Therefore the vision of the 2300 years must be the topic.</p>


<h4>The Starting-Point</h4>

<p>First of all, the angel said that a short period was to be
cut off from the long period, and allotted to the Jewish people;
this short period was to reach to the coming of the promised
Messiah and the filling up of the measure of Jerusalem's
transgressions. The angel's own words are:</p>

<p>"Seventy weeks [490 days, prophetic time, or 490 literal
years] are determined [cut off, as the word means] upon thy
people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression,
and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for
iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy."
Verse 24.</p>

<p>This 490-year period "cut off" was to cover the history
of the people of Jerusalem until that city had filled out the
measure of its transgression. The only prophetic period
from which this 490 years can properly be said to be "cut
off" is, assuredly, the longer period of 2300 years, which
stretches far onward to "the time of the end." The 490
years and the 2300 years, then, must begin at the same time.</p>

<p>It was the time period that the angel Gabriel was yet to
explain; and he begins the explanation by showing that the
first 490 years of it would reach to the days of the Messiah.
Then he gives the event that marks the beginning of the 490
years, which event must necessarily mark the beginning of
the 2300 years as well.</p>

<p>This is what he was commissioned to make Daniel "understand"
when first the vision of the 2300 years was given.
Now he tells him to "understand" it:</p>

<p>"Know therefore and understand, that from the going
forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem
unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore
and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the
wall, even in troublous times. And after threescore and two
weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for Himself: and the
people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city
and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood,
and unto the end of the war desolations are determined."
Dan. 9:25, 26.</p>

<p>The date of the going forth of the commandment to restore
and rebuild Jerusalem is the date, therefore, from which
the great prophetic measuring line runs; the first 490 years of
it to reach to the time and work of the Messiah, at the first
advent, the full 2300 years running on to mark the time when
the judgment hour in heaven opens. Once the starting-point
is fixed, all the events of the long period must follow
exactly as scheduled in the time-table of divine prophecy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>


<h4>Date of the Commencement to Restore Jerusalem</h4>

<p>There were several commands issued concerning the restoration
of Jerusalem after the Babylonish captivity. Cyrus,
and Darius, and Artaxerxes Longimanus each issued such a
decree. Which one answers to the language of the prophecy
as "the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem"?</p>

</div>

<p>The decree of Artaxerxes was most comprehensive (Ezra
7), authorizing the full restoration of the civil and religious
administration of Jerusalem and Judea. And Inspiration
specifically sums up all the decrees as completed only in that
of Artaxerxes, which thus constituted "the commandment:"</p>

<p>"They builded, and finished it, according to the commandment
of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment
of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of

<p>According to this scripture, the full "going forth of the
commandment to restore and to build," dates from this decree
of Artaxerxes. And this decree went forth "in the seventh
year of Artaxerxes the king." Ezra 7:7.</p>

<p>What year was this seventh year of Artaxerxes&mdash;a date
so important to fix to a certainty?</p>

<p>The great chronological standard for the kings of the
ancient empires is the canon, or historical rule, of Ptolemy.
Ptolemy was a Greek historian, geographer, and astronomer,
who lived in the temple of Serapis, near Alexandria, Egypt.
From ancient records he prepared a chronological table of
the kings of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome (carrying
the Roman list to his own time, which was the second century
after Christ). Along with his list of kings and the years of
their succession, Ptolemy compiled a record of ancient observations
of eclipses. In such and such a year of a king,
for instance, on a given day of the month, an eclipse of the
sun or moon would be recorded. Astronomers have worked
out these observations, and verified them. The learned Dr.
William Hales said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To the authenticity of these copies of Ptolemy's canon, the strongest
testimony is given by their exact agreement throughout, with above
twenty dates and computations of eclipses in Ptolemy's
Almagest."&mdash;<i>"Chronology,"
Vol. I, p. 166.</i></p></div>

<p>Thus, says James B. Lindsay, an English chronologist,
"a foundation is laid for chronology sure as the stars." So
the sun and the stars, the divinely appointed timekeepers,
bear their witness to the accuracy of the historical record.</p>

<p>We thank God for this, as we desire to know if we may
depend upon Ptolemy's canon to help us fix to a certainty
the seventh year of Artaxerxes.</p>

<p>According to Ptolemy, Artaxerxes succeeded to the throne
in the two hundred and eighty-fourth year of the canon. In
modern reckoning, this two hundred and eighty-fourth year
runs from Dec. 17, 465 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, to Dec. 17, 464 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> The canon
does not tell at what part of the year a king succeeded to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
throne; it only deals with whole years. The question is, to
be exact, Did Artaxerxes come to the throne in December,
465 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, or at some time in the year 464 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>? At what
season of the year did the king take the throne? Some historians,
dealing with the matter roughly, date the succession
from the year 465. But in dealing with divine prophecy, we
require certainty upon which to base the reckoning of the seventh
year of Artaxerxes, from which date the prophetic period
runs.</p>

<p>And in God's providence we do have certainty. Of all
the kings of Assyria, Babylon, and Medo-Persia, in Ptolemy's
long list, there is but one concerning whose succession the
Scriptures give us the very time of the year&mdash;and that one
is Artaxerxes. The one case in which we need to know to a
certainty the season of the year, in order to fix an important
date in prophecy, is the one case in which Inspiration gives
exactly the particulars. Who cannot see the hand of God in
this?</p>

<p>The combined record of Neh. 1:1; 2:1 and Ezra 7:7-9,<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>
shows that Artaxerxes came to the throne between the fifth
month of the Jewish year and the ninth month,&mdash;roughly,
between August and December,&mdash;or in the autumn. The
Bible gives one part of the record, and Ptolemy's canon gives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
another part; and by the combined record we know that
Artaxerxes came to the throne late in the year 464 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and
thus the seventh year of his reign would be 457 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> This is
the date fixed by other sources of reliable chronology also, Sir
Isaac Newton having worked out several lines of evidence
from ancient authorities, in each case reaching the year 464
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span> as the first of Artaxerxes, which makes the seventh to
be 457 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>In the seventh year of Artaxerxes the commandment went
forth to restore and to build Jerusalem, and this event fixes
the beginning of the 2300 years, as also of the 490 years cut
off from it upon the Jewish people.</p>

<p>That year, 457 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, therefore, is a date of profound importance.
It stands like the golden milestone in the ancient
Forum at Rome, from which ran out all the measurements
of distance to the ends of the empire. From this date, 457
<span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, run out the golden threads of time prophecy that touch
events in the earthly life and the heavenly ministry of Jesus
that are of deepest eternal interest to all mankind today.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_G_7" id="Footnote_G_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_G_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> The dates placed in the margin of the King James Version indicate a
period of fifteen years between the eighth and ninth chapters of Daniel. This
was because in former days it was thought that Belshazzar was the Bible
name of Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon, who reigned seventeen years.
In that case, from "the third year" of his reign, when the prophecy of Daniel
8 was given, to the "first year of Darius," who succeeded him, when the
angel appeared again to Daniel, would be fifteen years. But the unearthing
of the buried records of Babylonia during the last half century, reveals the
fact that Belshazzar was the son of Nabonidus, associated with him on the
throne as king for a few years before the fall of Babylon. The third year of
his reign may very likely have been the last year; and Darius immediately
followed Belshazzar. The explanation of the ninth chapter might have been
within a few weeks or months following the vision of chapter 8, and probably
was.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_H_8" id="Footnote_H_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_H_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> These texts show that the king came to the throne in the autumn, so
that the actual years of his reign would run from autumn to autumn. Neh.
1:1 begins the record: "In the month Chisleu, in the <i>twentieth year</i>."
Neh.
2:1 continues: "It came to pass in the month Nisan, in the <i>twentieth year</i>
of Artaxerxes." Thus it is plain that in the monthly calendar of the king's
actual reign the month Chisleu came first in order, and then Nisan. Chisleu
was the ninth month of the Jewish sacred year, roughly, December. Nisan
is the first month, April. And these months, December, April,&mdash;in that
order,&mdash;came
in the first year of the king, of course, the same as in his twentieth
year. And in the same year also came the fifth month, August; for Ezra
7:7-9 shows that the first and fifth months&mdash;in that order&mdash;also fell in the
same year of his reign. Then we know of a certainty that his reign began
somewhere between August and December, that is, in the autumn. The first
year of Artaxerxes was from the latter part of 464 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to the latter
part of
463, and the seventh year, as readily counted off, would be from near the end
of 458 to near the end of 457. Under the commission to Ezra, the people
began to go up to Jerusalem in the spring of that year, 457 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> (in
the first
month, or April), and they "came to Jerusalem in the fifth month" (August).
Ezra 7:8, 9. Ezra and his associates soon thereafter "delivered the kings
commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the
river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God." Ezra 8:36.
With this delivery of the commissions to the king's officers, the commandment
to restore and to build had, most certainly, fully gone forth. And from this
date, 457 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, extends the great prophetic period.</p></div></div>

<h2><a name="THE_PROPHECY_FULFILLED" id="THE_PROPHECY_FULFILLED"></a>THE PROPHECY FULFILLED</h2>

<h3>EVENTS OF THE "SEVENTY WEEKS" AND END OF THE
2300 YEARS</h3>


<p>The angel explained to Daniel the events of the seventy
weeks allotted to Jerusalem and its people "to finish the
transgression." Seven weeks and threescore and two weeks
(69 weeks) of the seventy were to reach to the Messiah. The
angel's words were:</p>

<p>"Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and
upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression.... Know
therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the
commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the
Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and
two weeks [69 weeks, or 483 days]." Dan. 9:24, 25.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>The sixty-nine weeks, symbolic time, are 483 years, which
were to reach from the commandment to restore and build
Jerusalem to Messiah the Prince.</p>


<h4>The Time of the Messiah's Coming</h4>

<p>The commandment of Artaxerxes to restore and build
Jerusalem, as we have seen, went forth in 457 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> Reckoning
from that date, 483 full years bring us to <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 27, when,
according to the prophecy, the Messiah should appear.</p>

<p>Messiah means "anointed." The anointing of Jesus, and
His manifestation as the Anointed One, was at His baptism:</p>

<p>"Jesus, when He was baptized, went up straightway out
of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto Him,
and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting
upon Him: and lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is
My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Matt. 3:16, 17.</p>

<p>Thus Jesus was anointed as the Messiah (see Acts 10:38),
and John proclaimed: "Behold the Lamb of God, which
taketh away the sin of the world." John 1:29.</p>

<p>When did this baptism and anointing take place? The
Gospel of Luke supplies the historical facts for fixing the
year:</p>

<p>"In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius C&aelig;sar,
Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea," etc. Luke 3:1-3.</p>

<p>Tiberius followed Augustus, who died in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 14. But
before the latter's death, Tiberius was associated with him
on the throne. Some modern historians date this appointment
of Tiberius as C&aelig;sar from <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 13; but the "History of
Rome," by Dion Cassius, a Roman senator, born in the second
century, shows, under events of <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 12, that Augustus recognized
Tiberius as holding the imperial dignity at that time.
(Book 56, chap. 26.) Again, Dr. Philip Schaff says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There are coins from Antioch in Syria of the date A.U. 765 [<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 12],
with the head of Tiberius and the inscription, <i>Kaisar, Sebastos
(Augustus)."</i>&mdash;<i>"History
of the Christian Church," Vol. I, p. 120, footnote.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>These coins from Syria bear certain witness that the first
year of Tiberius should be counted from <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 12. Therefore
"the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius C&aelig;sar" would be
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 27, just 483 years from the going forth of the commandment
to restore Jerusalem. The prophecy of the sixty-nine
weeks was fulfilled&mdash;the Messiah had come.</p>


<h4>Confirming the Covenant</h4>

<p>But "one week" of the seventy remained&mdash;seven years.
Of the Messiah's work during this time the angel said:</p>

<p>"He shall confirm the covenant with many for one week:
and in the midst of the week He shall cause the sacrifice and
the oblation to cease." Dan. 9:27.</p>

<p>Christ's death upon the cross made "the sacrifice and the
oblation to cease," so far as their appointed force was concerned.
After three years and a half of ministry, "in the
midst" of this seven-year period, the prophetic week, the Messiah
was lifted up on Calvary. For centuries the sure word
of prophecy had pointed to this supreme hour in the working
out of the plan of salvation. When the time was fulfilled,
the promise of God was fulfilled also, and the divine
Sacrifice was offered.</p>

<p>The Messiah was to "confirm the covenant with many for
one week," filling out the seventy weeks allotted in God's
merciful patience especially to the people of the Jews. Three
and a half years of Christ's personal ministry on earth had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
been devoted to the chosen people. Now, after His ascension,
He was still, in the persons of His disciples, to press
the gospel of the new covenant especially upon the Jewish
people&mdash;"to the Jew first," and "beginning at Jerusalem."</p>

</div>

<p>This last seven-year period, beginning in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 27, ended
in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 34. By that time the opposition of the Jews was becoming
exceedingly bitter. As a people they were rejecting
again the divine invitation extended by the risen Christ
through His witnesses. About <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 34 Stephen was martyred.
The same council that, against all evidence, had rejected
the Messiah, again rejected the appeal of the Holy
Ghost shining visibly on Stephen's countenance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>The believers in Jerusalem were driven out by persecution;
and "they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching
the word." Acts 8:4. The Gentiles gave heed in Samaria,
and the Ethiopian received the gospel on the road to
Gaza. The gospel message had fairly passed the boundaries
of Jerusalem and was on its way to the "uttermost parts of
the earth."</p>

<p>Though the seventy weeks cut off upon the Jewish people
and upon the holy city had ended, to the world's end the
gospel of Christ's salvation is for that people as well as for
all other nations.</p>


<h4>The Ending of the 2300 Years</h4>

<p>It must not be forgotten that the angel was explaining
to Daniel the vision and prophecy of the long prophetic period
that was to reach to the cleansing of the sanctuary at the
time of the end.</p>

<p>These events of the first seventy weeks of that period
were "to seal up the vision and prophecy." Dan. 9:24. The
shedding of the blood of the divine Sacrifice "to make reconciliation
for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness,"
set Heaven's seal to the vision. As surely as the great
Offering had been made, so surely the cleansing of the sanctuary
would be accomplished by the ministry of our High
Priest in heaven.</p>

<p>And the exact fulfilment of the time schedule for this
first portion of the prophetic period, set seal to the declaration
that when the full 2300 years should run out, the closing ministry
of Christ would surely begin in the heavenly sanctuary.</p>

<p>From 457 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when the commandment of Artaxerxes
to restore Jerusalem went forth, the measuring line of the
2300 years reaches to the year <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1844. In that year the
time of the prophecy came. Then the cleansing of the sanctuary
was to begin.</p>

<p>The prophet John, in the Revelation, beheld the opening
of this last phase of the ministry of Christ in the most holy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
place of the temple of God. "The temple of God was
opened in heaven," he says, "and there was seen in His
temple the ark of His testament." Rev. 11:19. The
prophet heard voices saying, "The nations were angry, and
Thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they
should be judged." Verse 18.</p>

<p>Again we must quote Daniel's description of the opening
of this ministry in the most holy place of the heavenly temple.
He saw thrones of judgment set up. He saw the moving
throne of the Almighty, with its wheels of naming glory, take
its position for the final work of our High Priest in the holy
of holies above:</p>

<p>"I beheld till the thrones were cast down [placed], and
the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow,
and the hair of His head like the pure wool: His throne was
like the fiery flame, and His wheels as burning fire. A fiery
stream issued and came forth from before Him: thousand
thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten
thousand stood before Him: the judgment was set, and the
books were opened." Dan. 7:9, 10.</p>

<p>This was the scene enacted in the heavenly temple when
the year 1844 brought the judgment hour. Then began in
heaven the work of the investigative judgment, or the cleansing
of the heavenly sanctuary, during which the case of every
individual will come in review before God.</p>

<p>When that work of investigation is finished, the ministry
of Christ for sin will end, human probation will close, and our
Lord will quickly come as King of kings and Lord of lords, to
gather His redeemed, while all sinners will be destroyed by
"the brightness of His coming." 2 Thess. 2:8.</p>

<p>In the vision of Daniel 8, as the great apostasy was seen
warring against God's truth, the question was asked, "How
long shall be the vision,... to give both the sanctuary and
the host to be trodden underfoot?" The answer was, in
effect, In 1844 the cleansing of the sanctuary will begin in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
heaven,&mdash;the hour of God's judgment, that will give God's
answer to sin and apostasy.</p>

<p>We are living in the great antitypical day of atonement,
for which all heaven has been waiting. The end is at hand.
And while that work is proceeding in heaven above, the Lord
proclaims a special message on earth, lifting up again truths
long trodden underfoot, and calling men to prepare for the
coming of the Lord.</p>

<h2><a name="A_WORLD-WIDE_MOVEMENT" id="A_WORLD-WIDE_MOVEMENT"></a>A WORLD-WIDE MOVEMENT</h2>

<h3>FORETOLD IN THE PROPHECY OF REVELATION 14</h3>


<p>While the work of the judgment hour, or period,&mdash;the
cleansing of the sanctuary,&mdash;is proceeding in the heavenly
temple above, the Lord sends to the world a special message
of preparation for the coming of the Lord.</p>

<p>It would not be the divine way to let this solemn judgment
in heaven come unheralded to men. Daniel's prophecy
had fixed the time of its beginning; and the question asked
in the prophet's hearing, "How long shall be the vision ...
to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden underfoot?"
suggested that when the time came, the truths of God
that had been trodden underfoot through the ages would be
lifted up and proclaimed anew to all the world.</p>

<p>With the coming of the judgment hour, in the year 1844,
there arose just such a work, a definite gospel movement,
that has ever since been carrying the message for the hour
to the ends of the earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>


<h4>The Way Prepared for the Rise of the Movement</h4>

<p>But there was a preliminary work to be done, to prepare
the way for the definite advent movement and message.</p>

<p>In the days of Israel of old, as the time for the cleansing
of the sanctuary drew near, the people were forewarned of
the approach of the solemn hour. The day of atonement&mdash;"the
tenth day of the seventh month"&mdash;was a typical
hour of judgment. All the people were to prepare their
hearts for that great day.</p>

<p>To this end, the Lord appointed the first day of the seventh
month a day of sounding of the trumpets. Lev. 23:24. The
silver trumpets, pealing forth on that day, proclaimed to all
that the day of atonement was near at hand, when every case
would be brought in review before the mercy-seat by the
ministry of the high priest in the most holy place of the
earthly sanctuary.</p>

<p>True to the type, as the year 1844 drew near, when the
great antitypical day of atonement was to open and the closing
work of Christ to begin in the most holy place of the
heavenly temple, the trumpet call of the approaching judgment
hour was set pealing through all Christendom.</p>

<p>Events of the closing years of the eighteenth century and
the early decades of the nineteenth, had stirred up Bible
students to give greater attention to the study of the prophetic
scriptures. It was seen that signs of the latter days were appearing,
and that every line of historic prophecy pointed to
the near approach of Christ's second coming.</p>

<p>Here and there students of the Word saw that the 2300-year
period of Dan. 8:14, as explained in the ninth chapter,
would end soon; and some arrived at the correct date, and
looked to the year 1844 as the time when the judgment hour
would come.</p>

<p>Witnesses were raised up in Europe&mdash;in Holland, Germany,
Russia, and the Scandinavian countries. Joseph Wolff,
the missionary to the Levant, preached in Greece, Palestine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Turkey, Afghanistan, and other regions the coming of the
judgment hour. William Miller and many associates preached
the message throughout America.</p>

<p>Writing in the days just before 1844, Mourant Brock, a
clergyman of the Church of England, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is not merely in Great Britain that the expectation of the near
return of the Redeemer is entertained, and the voice of warning raised,
but also in America, India, and on the continent of Europe. In America,
about three hundred ministers of the word are thus preaching 'this gospel
of the kingdom;' whilst in this country, about seven hundred of the
Church of England are raising the same cry."&mdash;<i>"Advent Tracts</i>," <i>Vol.
II, p. 135 (1844).</i></p></div>

<p>Not all who joined in the awakening cry at this time explained
the prophecies alike, or emphasized the definite year
1844 as the beginning of the hour of God's judgment; though
in America, Europe, and Asia the clear message of the ending
of the prophetic time in 1844 was proclaimed with power by
many voices. And as the time came, the world was ringing
with the call to prepare to meet the judgment hour, even as
the hosts of Israel were called by trumpet peals to prepare
for the typical day of atonement.</p>

<p>The nature of the event to come at the end of the 2300
years was not understood by these early heralds of the advent
hope. The general expectation was that the judgment hour
meant the end of the world and the coming of the Lord.
Though the word of prophecy indicated clearly that there
was a special work to be done on earth while the judgment
hour was proceeding in heaven, this was not clear to Bible
students at the time. So when the prophetic period ended
and the Lord did not come, believers in the prophetic truths
were disappointed and unbelievers scoffed. But the call to
prepare for the judgment hour was the message due to the
world at that time, and the awakening cry was raised on
every continent.</p>

<p>In the days of the Saviour's first advent, the disciples
and the populace had proclaimed the triumphal entry of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Christ into Jerusalem. They were at once disappointed; instead
of enthroning Him as king, they witnessed His crucifixion.
But in proclaiming the coming of Zion's King to
Jerusalem, they were fulfilling the prophecy that had been
uttered, and were giving the message for that day, notwithstanding
their mistaken view as to the events that would
follow.</p>

<p>Just so the trumpet call of the coming judgment hour was
the message for the days of 1844; and the message was given,
attended by the power of God. When the hour was at hand,
the providence of God raised up faithful witnesses to proclaim
it.</p>

<p>All this was preparatory to the rise of the definite advent
movement of the prophecy, when the hour of God's judgment
should begin.</p>


<h4>The Closing Work</h4>

<p>In vision, on the Isle of Patmos, the prophet John was
given a view of the closing work of the gospel on earth, while
the closing ministry of Christ was proceeding in heaven above.
The prophet wrote:</p>

<p>"I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having
the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory
to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship
Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains
of waters." Rev. 14:6, 7.</p>

<p>The message further warned against following the ways
of the great apostasy; and in the vision the prophet was shown
people in all lands taking their stand at the call of the message.
The angel described them in these words:</p>

<p>"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that
keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
Verse 12.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>Much as pictures appear to us when thrown in succession
upon a screen, these scenes must have passed before the vision
of the prophet. He saw the coming of the hour, the rise of
the movement, and its extension into all lands; he heard the
message sounding, and saw the kind of people doing the work&mdash;a
people keeping "the commandments of God, and the
faith of Jesus."</p>

</div>

<p>Centuries had passed, after this word was written in the
Book, when the flight of time at last brought the hour of
the prophecy&mdash;the year 1844. That very year witnessed
the rise of the definite advent movement which is still proclaiming
the very message of the prophecy to the world.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1844, in New England, that a little
group of believers in the blessed hope of Christ's soon coming,
saw clearly, from their study of the Bible, that the New Testament
platform of "the commandments of God, and the faith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
of Jesus," emphasized in this prophecy of the judgment hour,
meant the keeping of the fourth commandment as well as the
other nine. Thereupon they began to keep and to teach the
Sabbath of the Lord, the seventh day of the week, made holy
and blessed and commanded by God.</p>

<p>One member of this group of commandment-keeping Adventists
was Frederick Wheeler, from whose dictation the
following statement was prepared, fixing exactly the facts as
to the time:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As a Methodist minister he was convinced of the advent truth by
reading William Miller's works in 1842, and joined in preaching the first
message [that of the judgment hour]. In March, 1844, he began to keep
the true Sabbath, in Washington, N.H."&mdash;<i>Review and Herald (Washington,
D.C.), Oct. 4, 1906.</i></p></div>

<p>They were but a little band, those believers in New Hampshire,
but the time of the prophecy had come, and with the
coming of the hour there was the nucleus of the movement
forming, believers in the near coming of the Lord, preaching
the message of the prophecy, "The hour of His judgment
is come," and keeping "the commandments of God, and the
faith of Jesus."</p>

<p>From that small beginning has grown the movement that
Seventh-day Adventists stand for, spreading through all the
world today.</p>

<p>It was in the year following 1844 that Joseph Bates, of
Massachusetts, a retired sea captain, and a preacher of the
advent hope, began to keep the Sabbath. Captain Bates
wrote and published, and soon others, following his example,
embraced the Bible Sabbath.</p>

<p>As the Scripture teaching concerning the sanctuary was
studied, light came flooding in. It was seen that the great
prophetic period of Daniel 8, which ended in 1844, marked
the opening of Christ's ministry in the most holy place of the
heavenly sanctuary, the work of the judgment hour in heaven;
and there, plainly revealed in Revelation 14, was a special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
gospel message to be carried to all the world while the judgment
hour still continued.</p>

<p>The little company that began to keep the commandments
of God as Adventist believers in 1844, did not understand
that they were beginning the definite movement foretold
by the prophecy. They only determined to turn from
traditions that had made void God's law, and to obey the law
of the Most High, whose servants they were.</p>

<p>But in the light of the Scripture prophecy and of events,
we can see clearly the hand of God leading that little baud
into the right pathway when the year of 1844 came; and the
work there begun has grown into the world-wide movement
of today.</p>

<p>Nearly two thousand years before, it had been written in
the "sure word of prophecy" that when the hour of God's
judgment came, a people keeping God's commandments
would arise and spread forth into all the world with the last
gospel message. The long prophetic period of Daniel 8 had
fixed the year 1844 as the time when the judgment hour would
begin and when the people of the prophecy must appear.</p>

<p>When the year came, that people appeared, keeping "the
commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." When the
hour struck, the work began. This advent movement was
born of God in fulfilment of prophecy. And the mission of
the movement is to lift up again the standard of truths obscured
by tradition and trodden underfoot, and to call all men
to the New Testament platform of the "commandments
of God, and the faith of Jesus," where every believing soul
may find safe refuge in these closing moments of the judgment
hour in the courts above.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_JUDGMENT-HOUR_MESSAGE" id="THE_JUDGMENT-HOUR_MESSAGE"></a>THE JUDGMENT-HOUR MESSAGE</h2>

<h3>THE GOSPEL FOR OUR DAY</h3>


<p>The gospel message for this time of the judgment hour
is set forth in the vision of Revelation 14:</p>

<p>"I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having
the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to
Him; for the hour of His judgment is come: and worship Him
that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains
of waters.</p>

<p>"And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is
fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations
drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>

<p>"And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud
voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive
his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall
drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
without mixture into the cup of His indignation; and he shall
be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the
holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke
of their torment ascendeth up forever and ever: and they have
no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image,
and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</p>

<p>"Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that
keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
Rev. 14:6-12.</p>

<p>When this message has been heralded to all nations, according
to prophecy the end will come, for the next scene
brought before the prophet's vision was the coming of Christ
to reap the harvest of the earth:</p>

<p>"I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud
one sat like unto the Son of man, having on His head a golden
crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle." Verse 14.</p>

<p>The outline of the message given here reveals certain main
features:</p>


<h4>1. A Gospel Message</h4>

<p>It is not a new or another gospel. There is but one gospel.
This message is "the everlasting gospel" in terms that meet
the situation in the time of the judgment hour. The advent
movement carries the blessed message of full salvation from
sin by faith in Jesus Christ.</p>


<h4>2. A Solemn Warning</h4>

<p>The message is God's final answer to the age-long perversions
of His truth. Even the warnings uttered vibrate with
the saving grace and winning power of God's love in Christ
Jesus our Lord.</p>

<p>In the vision of Daniel 8, the prophet was shown the
working of apostasy in the latter times, as it "cast down the
truth to the ground" and "practiced and prospered." But
in answer to the question, "How long?" the great prophetic
period of the 2300 years was given, at the end of which (in
1844) the judgment work in heaven was to begin. When that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
work is finished, Christ's glorious appearing will end the reign
of sin and error.</p>

<p>And while the closing judgment work is proceeding in
heaven, this message of the judgment hour lifts up on earth
the standard of truths trodden underfoot, and the Lord utters
His last warning against sin and apostasy. It is a terrible
word that He speaks. Bengelius described it as&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"that threatening pronounced which is the greatest in all the Scriptures,
and which shall resound powerfully from the mouth of the third
angel."&mdash;<i>"Introduction
to Apocalypse," Preface xxix (London, 1757).</i></p></div>

<p>The Lord is in earnest with men in this hour when the
judgment, now passing on the dead, must also soon seal the
eternal destiny of all the living. Hence the message challenges
every soul to a decision.</p>

<p>Looking forward to the time when this message should
be due, John Wesley wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Happy are they who make the right use of these divine messages."&mdash;<i>"Notes
on New Testament," on Revelation 14.</i></p></div>

<p>These warnings are part of the "everlasting gospel."
Whosoever, therefore, preaches the full gospel of Christ in
these last days must sound this solemn call.</p>


<h4>3. A Call to Loyalty to God</h4>

<p>"Fear God," is the call, "Worship Him." In the preceding
vision of the thirteenth chapter, the Lord had shown
the prophet the work of an ecclesiastical power, symbolized
by a leopardlike beast, that was to speak great things, and
that was to persecute believers through long centuries, warring
against God's truth and His sanctuary. "All the world
wondered after the beast." The prophet said,</p>

<p>"All that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose
names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb." Rev.
13:8.</p>

<p>While worldly influence and the voice of popular religion
exalt this ecclesiastical power and give glory to it, the gospel
message calls all men to worship God.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His
judgment is come: and worship Him.... If any man worship
the beast and his image, and receive his mark,<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> ...
the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God."</p>

<p>The issue, it is clear, involves the question of authority.
Shall God be recognized as supreme? or shall this ecclesiastical
power, whose rise and work were foretold in the prophecy,
be recognized as the great authority?</p>


<h4>The Work of the Papal Power</h4>

<p>Any comparison between this leopard beast of Revelation
13 and the "little horn" of the fourth beast of Daniel 7, shows
plainly that the same power is represented in each. The same
voice is heard "speaking great things," the same persecuting
spirit is shown, the same warfare against God's truth. It is the
Roman Papacy, in its exaltation of human authority above the
divine, that "lawless one" of Paul's prophecy, setting itself
forth as God in the temple of God, treading underfoot the word
and the law of the Most High, as foretold by Daniel:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>"He shall speak great words against the Most High, and
shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to
change times and laws." Dan. 7:25.</p>

<p>Against the recognition of the assumed authority of this
power, the gospel message of Revelation 14 sounds its solemn
warning: "If any man worship the beast and his image, and
receive his mark."</p>


<h4>The Image to the Papacy</h4>

<p>What is this image? Plainly an image to the Papacy
must be some religious authority or federation not organically
of the Papacy itself, but adopting papal principles and
seeking to enforce these principles by civil power, just as the
Papacy has ever done, where possible. This development in
likeness of the Papacy was shown the prophet in the latter
part of the vision of Revelation 13. He saw the image formed,
and in vision witnessed its determined efforts to enforce upon
men the mark, or sign, of the Papacy:</p>

<p>"He exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,
and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship
the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed....
And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free
and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their
foreheads: and that no man might buy or sell, save he that
had the mark, or the name of the beast." Rev. 13:12-17.</p>


<h4>The Mark, or Sign, of Papal Authority</h4>

<p>The Roman Papacy sets forth the Sunday institution as
the mark of the authority of the church to substitute ecclesiastical
tradition and custom for the Word of God. Thus,
Monsignor S&eacute;gur, in "Plain Talks about the Protestantism of
Today," says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The observance of Sunday by Protestants is an homage they pay, in
spite of themselves, to the authority of the church."&mdash;<i>Page 213.</i></p></div>

<p>It was to this change in the Sabbath by tradition, contrary
to the plain command of God to keep holy the seventh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
day, that the famous Council of Trent appealed when it gave
Rome's answer to the Reformation cry of "The Bible and
the Bible only." The council had long debated the ground
of its answer. The historian says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Finally, at the last opening on the eighteenth of January, 1562,
their last scruple was set aside; the archbishop of Rheggio made a speech
in which he openly declared that tradition stood above Scripture. The
authority of the church could therefore not be bound to the authority of
the Scriptures, because the church had changed Sabbath into Sunday,
not by the command of Christ, but by its own authority. With this, to
be sure, the last illusion was destroyed, and it was declared that tradition
does not signify antiquity, but continual inspiration."&mdash;<i>Dr. J.H. Holtzman,
"Canon and Tradition," p. 263.</i></p></div>

<p>Ever since this memorable council, the Sunday institution
has been held forth as the mark of the power of the church to
command religious observances. Thus, again, Keenan's "Doctrinal
Catechism" says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>Question.</i>&mdash;Have you any other way of proving that the church has
power to institute festivals of precept?"</p>

<p>"<i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Had she not such power, she could not have done that in
which all modern religionists agree with her,&mdash;she could not have substituted
the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance
of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no
Scriptural authority."&mdash;<i>Page 174.</i></p></div>

<p>The prophecy of Daniel declared that this power would
"think" to change the times and laws of the Most High; and
the change of the Sabbath commandment is set forth as the
mark of the church's authority above the written law of the
Most High.</p>

<p>Most remarkable of all, Protestant organizations are defending
the unscriptural observance of the humanly established
first-day sabbath in contradiction to the law of God,
which declares that "the seventh day is the Sabbath of the
Lord thy God." And these organizations, in denial of the
Protestant principle of religious liberty, are seeking power
to enforce Sunday observance by civil law. But this is to
make a very image to the Roman Papacy&mdash;a church using
the power of the state to enforce religious observance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>It was all foretold in the prophetic word. The prophet
was shown (Rev. 13:11-17) this likeness or image to the
Papacy&mdash;ecclesiastical organizations not of the Papacy itself,
but following papal principles in this matter&mdash;seeking
to compel men to receive the mark of the papal apostasy.</p>

<p>Against the workings of both the Papacy and this image
to the Papacy, the last message of the "everlasting gospel"
lifts its warning cry:</p>

<p>"If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive
his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink
of the wine of the wrath of God."</p>

<p>It is the time of the judgment hour, when God was to lift
up the standard of truths long trodden underfoot. In the
heavenly sanctuary Christ's closing judgment work is going
forward, preparatory to His coming in consuming glory to end
the reign of sin. On earth the Lord is sending the last gospel
message to men, warning against sin and error, and calling
all men to worship God, and to keep "the commandments of
God, and the faith of Jesus."</p>


<h4>The Sign of Jehovah's Authority</h4>

<p>God also has His sign, or mark, of authority. He bases
His claims to supreme authority upon the fact of His creative
power. As Creator, His is the authority and the power.</p>

<p>"The Lord is the true God.... He hath made the
earth by His power." Jer. 10:10-12.</p>

<p>And the divinely established memorial of this creative
power is the holy Sabbath. The Sabbath is the mark, or sign,
of the true God:</p>

<p>"Hallow My Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between
Me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your
God." Eze. 20:20.</p>

<p>On one side is the mark, or sign, of apostasy from God;
on the other the mark, or sign, of loyalty to God. Which
mark will men receive, as the issue is pressed upon every soul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
for decision? On which side shall we stand? Under whose
banner shall we be found when the judgment hour closes?</p>

do then with Jesus which is called
Christ?&quot; Matt. 27:22.</span>
</div>

<p>The test that came to Pilate comes anew to men as Christ's
message presses for acceptance. "What shall I do then with
Jesus?" asked the Roman governor&mdash;and yielded to popular
clamor. His fatal decision in the time of testing warns us
to decide for Christ and for the word of his salvation now, in
this hour of God's judgment.</p>

<p>The message of Rev. 14:6-14 is going to all the world now.
Every year thousands of new voices join in telling it. Printing
presses are printing it in many languages. Schools and
colleges in every continent are educating thousands of Seventh-day
Adventist youth, keeping before them, as the highest
aim of life, the hastening of the advent message to the world.
Sanitariums in many lands, while training medical missionary
evangelists, are at the same time ministering to the sick,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
and teaching the principles of Bible health and temperance.
The movement necessarily emphasizes every principle of "the
everlasting gospel," while pressing upon all the solemn issue
that loyalty to Christ now means to turn from unscriptural
tradition and custom to the commandments of God and the
faith of Jesus. However ancient the custom of observing Sunday,
it is but an innovation, setting aside the Word of God and
the example of Jesus Christ. As St. Cyprian said: "Usage
without truth is only an antiquated error." The clear light
of Holy Scripture now calls the believer away from the path
of error to the way of light.</p>

<p>In times past Christian believers have been unwittingly
following the lead of the Papacy in this matter. The Lord
holds no man accountable for light that he did not have.
Reformation is a progressive work. Of the past we may
say with Paul:</p>

<p>"The times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
commandeth all men everywhere to repent: because He hath
appointed a day, in the which He will judge the world in
righteousness." Acts 17:30, 31.</p>

<p>Now, with this "hour of God's judgment" already come,
the entire covering of papal tradition is to be torn aside, and
when Jesus comes in glory, in every land will be found believers
having the faith and keeping the commandments of
God.</p>

<p>All this was shown to John on the Isle of Patmos,&mdash;the
coming of the judgment hour, the rise of the advent movement,
and the heralding of the last message to the nations.</p>

<p>What John saw in vision nearly two thousand years ago,
we see fulfilling before our eyes today. But it is not enough
to see it; we must have a part in it, be a part of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

The use of a mark, or sign, to designate the divinity worshiped, is common
in non-Christian religions. One may see the Hindu returning from the
temple with the mark of Vishnu or other deity freshly painted upon the forehead.
Of the ancient usage, from which this Bible symbol of the "mark" is
taken, Dr. John Potter says, in his "Antiquities of Greece:"
</p><p>
"Slaves were not only branded with stigmata for a punishment of their
offenses, but (which was the common end of these marks) to distinguish them,
in case they should desert their masters; for which purpose it was common
to brand their soldiers; only with this difference, that whereas slaves were
commonly stigmatized in their forehead, and with the name or some peculiar
character belonging to their masters, soldiers were branded in the hand, and
with the name or character of their general. After the same manner, it was
likewise customary to stigmatize the worshipers and votaries of some of the
gods: whence Lucian, speaking of the votaries of the Syrian goddess, affirms,
'They were all branded with certain marks, some in the palms of their hands,
and others in their necks: whence it became customary for all the Assyrians
thus to stigmatize themselves.' And Theodoret is of opinion that the Jews
were forbidden to brand themselves with stigmata [Lev. 19:28], because the
idolaters by that ceremony used to consecrate themselves to their false deities.
</p><p>
"The marks used on these occasions were various. Sometimes they contained
the name of the god, sometimes his particular ensign; such were the
thunderbolt of Jupiter, the trident of Neptune, the ivy of Bacchus: whence
Ptolemy Philopater was by some nicknamed Gallus, because his body was
marked with the figures of ivy leaves. Or, lastly, they marked themselves
with some mystical number, whereby the god's name was described. Thus
the sun, which was signified by the number DCVIII, is said to have been
represented
by these two numeral letters XH (Conf. Martianus Capello). These
three ways of stigmatizing are all expressed by St. John in the book of
Revelation:
'And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and
bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: and that
no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast,
or the number of his name.'"&mdash;<i>Vol. I, pp. 65, 66 (London, 1728).</i></p></div></div>

<h2><a name="THE_ORIGIN_OF_EVIL" id="THE_ORIGIN_OF_EVIL"></a>THE ORIGIN OF EVIL</h2>


<p>The Beginning of the Great Controversy Between
Christ and Satan</p>

<p>The great controversy between good and evil, that has
been waged on earth ever since man's fall, had its origin in
heaven. Certain angels rebelled against God and His government.</p>

<p>"There was war in heaven: Michael and His angels fought
against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more
in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent,
called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole
world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were
cast out with him." Rev. 12:7-9.</p>

<p>Thus came the forces of evil into this world, which have
been working through all the ages to draw men from allegiance
to God, and to infuse into human hearts the same spirit of
disobedience which wrought the ruin of Satan and his angels.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>


<h4>The Cause of the Downfall</h4>

<p>Christ stated the principle: "If therefore the light that is
in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!" Matt. 6:23.</p>

<p>The principle finds its utmost application in the great
reversal, by which Lucifer, the light bearer in heaven, became
Satan, the adversary, the prince of darkness.</p>

<span class="caption">CHRIST AND NICODEMUS<br />

&quot;Except a man be born again, he cannot see

</div>

<p>In the pride and self-exaltation of Tyre, of old, the Lord
saw manifested the spirit of the god of this world; so, in declaring
His message of rebuke to the prince of Tyre, the Lord
describes the cause and history of Satan's fall:</p>

<p>"Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God.... Thou
art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee
so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast
walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou
wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
till iniquity was found in thee.... Thine heart was lifted
up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom
by reason of thy brightness." Eze. 28:13-17.</p>

<p>Likewise, in the swelling pride of Babylon the Lord recognized
the spirit of the leader of the rebellious angels. In
one of the messages to Babylon is this reference to the vaulting
ambition of Lucifer in heaven:</p>

<p>"How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer ["day-star,"
margin], son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the
ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said
in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne
above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the
congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above
the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High."
Isa. 14:12-14.</p>

<p>Lucifer, his powers now perverted to evil, deceived many
of the angels, persuading them to join him in rebellion against
the government of God; with the result that Satan and all
his host were cast out. Christ said, "I beheld Satan as lightning
fall from heaven." Luke 10:18.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Him the Almighty Power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurled headlong flaming from the ethereal sky."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>The Earth as the Battle Ground</h4>

<p>Then the great controversy which began in heaven was
transferred to this earth, and now centers around man. For
"that old serpent," the leader of the fallen angels, deceived
man, and persuaded him to distrust God and to choose his
own way in preference to God's way. Thus came sin and
death into the world. And Satan, who had overcome man
at the forbidden tree, became by his own usurpation and by
man's perfidy, "the prince of this world."</p>

<p>But Christ gave himself to save man, to deliver him from
the bondage of sin, and to restore him to the glorious liberty
of the sons of God. The same mighty power that overcame
Satan and his angels in heaven is able to overcome his power
in human hearts and lives. The controversy is still between
Christ and Satan, and man's salvation or destruction is the
aim of the contending forces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no neutral ground. Every soul must choose as
to which side he will yield allegiance. In this choice lies
his eternal destiny.</p>

<p>"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants
to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin
unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?" Rom. 6:16.</p>

<p>Therefore the Lord pleads with men, "Choose life."
Every soul that chooses life has the promise of it, for Christ
"is able ... to save them to the uttermost that come unto
God by Him." Heb. 7:25.</p>


<h4>The Judgment upon Satan</h4>

<p>From the time of Satan's rebellion it was assured, by the
very omnipotence of God, that there would come a last
judgment when evil would be destroyed from the universe.
This execution of judgment upon the fallen angels is thus referred
to by Jude:</p>

<p>"The angels which kept not their first estate, but left
their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains
under darkness unto the judgment of the great day." Verse 6.</p>

<p>The evil spirits themselves know that this day is coming.
When Christ was about to cast certain of them out of one who
was possessed, they cried out, "Art Thou come hither to
torment us before the time?" Matt. 8:29.</p>

<p>Though the judgment of that last day was originally set
for Satan and his angels, unrepentant men will have a part
in it, because they have joined Satan in his lawless rebellion.
To the wicked it will be said:</p>

<p>"Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared
for the devil and his angels." Matt. 25:41.</p>

<p>Satan sees that the day is hastening; and the shorter the
time in which to work, the greater his fury in seeking to draw
souls to perdition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>The warning comes to us in these last days:</p>

<p>"Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for
the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because
he knoweth that he hath but a short time." Rev. 12:12.</p>

<p>Christ's second coming ends the reign of Satan in this
world. The wicked are slain by the consuming glory of
Christ's coming (2 Thess. 2:8); and the righteous are taken
to heaven, beyond the reach of Satan's arts (1 Thess. 4:16,
17). The archenemy and his angels are thus left upon an
earth devoid of human beings. Here he is chained for a
thousand years, in this pit of desolation (Rev. 20:2, 5), his
only companions the angels who fell with him, his only occupation
the contemplation of the ruin he has wrought and the
destruction that still awaits him.</p>

<p>By the second resurrection&mdash;that of the wicked dead,
after the thousand years&mdash;Satan is again set free to ply his
arts upon his subjects. As the holy city comes down out of
heaven from God, with all the saints, Satan gathers his angels
and all the forces of the lost of all the ages, to make an
assault upon the city. The result was shown to the prophet
in vision:</p>

<p>"They went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed
the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city:
and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured
them. And the devil that deceiveth them was cast into the
lake of fire." Rev. 20:9, 10.</p>

<p>That is the fate awaiting the author of sin. In the account
of Satan's pride and self-exaltation, uttered by the
prophet in the message to Tyre, there occurs also this prophecy
of the utter destruction that awaits him, when he shall
bring his forces against the city of God in that last conflict:</p>

<p>"I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of
all them that behold thee. All they that know thee among
the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror,
and never shalt thou be any more." Eze. 28:18, 19.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>This is the final victory of Christ over evil, in the great
controversy that began in heaven. Satan exalted himself&mdash;and
lost. Christ humbled Himself, even unto the death&mdash;and
won the eternal triumph.</p>

<p>"Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh
and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same;
that through death He might destroy him that had the power
of death, that is, the devil." Heb. 2:14.</p>

<h2><a name="SPIRITUALISM_ANCIENT_AND_MODERN" id="SPIRITUALISM_ANCIENT_AND_MODERN"></a>SPIRITUALISM: ANCIENT AND MODERN</h2>


<p>The essential claim of Spiritualism is its assertion of
power to hold communication with the spirits of the dead; or
rather, it claims to have demonstrated that really there is
no death.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There is no death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What seems so is transition."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The late Prof. Alfred Russel Wallace, the English scientist,
said of Spiritualism:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It demonstrates, as completely as the fact can be demonstrated,
that the so-called dead are still alive."&mdash;<i>"On Miracles and Modern
Spiritualism"
(London, 1875), p. 212.</i></p></div>


<h4>First Declaration of the Doctrine</h4>

<p>In the very first book of the Bible is a similar claim: "Ye
shall not surely die." Gen. 3:4.</p>

<p>But this declaration, while recorded in the Scriptures, is
not the word of God. The Lord had declared to man that
disobedience would bring death. But Satan, as the tempter
in Eden, caused the woman to doubt the word of God: "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die." And
the woman believed the tempter rather than God, and so
sinned against the Creator.</p>

<p>Having tempted man to disobedience, so bringing death
into the world, what more natural, in the course of deception,
than to endeavor to persuade the human family that, after
all, there is no death; that what appears so is only an introduction
to fuller life and activity? "Ye shall not surely die."</p>

<span class="caption">PHARAOH&#39;S SORCERERS COUNTERFEITING
THE WORK OF GOD<br />

&quot;Now the magicians of Egypt, they also
did in like manner with their enchantments.&quot;
Ex. 7:11.</span>
</div>

<p>As mankind departed from right and lost the knowledge
of God, dead heroes were deified as gods, and much of the
pagan worship consisted in sacrifices to the spirits of the dead,
supposed to be living still and concerned with affairs in the
land of the living. When Israel fell away from God and
joined the Moabites in the worship of Baal-peor, the record
says of the nature of the service:</p>

<p>"They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate
the sacrifices of the dead." "Yea, they sacrificed their sons
and their daughters unto devils." Ps. 106:28, 37.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of dealing with the spirits of the dead, the idolatrous
worshipers were really putting themselves in direct
touch with the agencies of Satan, the fallen angels.</p>


<h4>Divine Warnings</h4>

<p>This explains the severity of the divine warnings against the
ancient practice of necromancy, or mediumship. The Lord said:</p>

<p>"Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek
after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your
God." Lev. 19:31.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">

OF CHRIST

&quot;He said unto him, Come out of the man,
thou unclean spirit.&quot; Mark 5:8." title="" />
<span class="caption">DEMONISM IN THE DAYS
OF CHRIST<br />

&quot;He said unto him, Come out of the man,
thou unclean spirit.&quot; Mark 5:8.</span>
</div>

<p>"When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy
God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations
of those nations. There shall not be found among you
any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through
the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or
an enchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. For all that do
these things are an abomination unto the Lord." Deut. 18:9-12.</p>

<p>The ancient s&eacute;ance, where the living sought unto the dead
for knowledge, was denounced by the prophet Isaiah:</p>

<p>"When they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that
have familiar spirits and unto the wizards, that chirp and
that mutter: should not a people seek unto their God? on
behalf of the living should they seek unto the dead?" Isa.
8:19, A.R.V.</p>

<p>"To the law and to the testimony!" the prophet cries.
To seek unto the dead for knowledge is to turn from the law
and the testimony, and to take the counsel of the direct agencies
of Satan, the great deceiver.</p>


<h4>Modern Spiritualism</h4>

<p>What Spiritualism is may best be understood by the prophetic
warnings concerning the revival of this great deception
in the last days. The apostle spoke of these days as a time
when seducing spirits would lead many away from the faith:</p>

<p>"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter
times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
spirits, and doctrines of devils." 1 Tim. 4:1.</p>

<p>This deceptive working is an indication of the nearness
of Christ's second coming:</p>

<p>"Whose coming is according to the working of Satan
with all power and signs and lying wonders." 2 Thess. 2:9,
A.R.V.</p>

<p>True to the sure word, now that the last days have come,
there has arisen the movement of modern Spiritualism, with
its signs and wonders, purporting to be wrought by the spirits
of the dead. Professor Wallace says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Modern Spiritualism dates from March, 1848; it being then that,
for the first time, intelligent communications were held with the unknown
cause of the mysterious knockings and other sounds similar to those which
had disturbed the Mompesson and Wesley families in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries."&mdash;<i>"On Miracles and Modern Spiritualism"
(London, 1875), p. 146.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in Hydeville, N.Y., in the family of Mr. Fox, that
the modern cult originated, it being found that by mysterious
but clear sounds of knocking, unseen intelligences were
able to communicate answers to questions asked. The rapidity
of the spread of the great deception was remarkable.
One of the Fox sisters, Mrs. A. Leah Underhill, wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Since that day, starting from a small country village of western
New York, Spiritualism has made its way&mdash;against tremendous obstacles
and resistance, but under an impulse and a guidance from higher spheres&mdash;round
the civilized globe. Starting from three sisters, two of them
children, and the eldest a little beyond that age,... its ranks of believers,
privately or publicly avowed, have grown within thirty-six years to
millions."&mdash;<i>"The Missing Link in Modern Spiritualism," Introduction.</i></p></div>

<p>Many at the time thought, as have many since, that the
"rappings" with which the manifestations began were caused
by some trickery on the part of the Fox sisters, but men of
unimpeachable standing and intelligence certified to the contrary.
Horace Greeley, famous editor of the New York <i>Tribune</i>,
wrote in his paper that the sisters had visited him in his
home and courted the fullest investigation as to "the alleged
manifestations from the spirit world." As the result of his
observations, he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Whatever may be the origin or the cause of the 'rappings,' the ladies
in whose presence they occur do not make them. We tested this thoroughly
and to our entire satisfaction."&mdash;<i>Id., pp. 160, 161.</i></p></div>

<p>It was no mere sleight of hand that launched this cult
upon the world as the last days came. Beyond all the physical
manifestations, the religious idea in Spiritualism has leavened
the religious thought of millions. No one can deny that the
basic idea is the one that the serpent promulgated in Eden,
"Ye shall not surely die."</p>

<p>Mrs. Emma Hardinge Britten, another of the Fox sisters,
says of the discovery of 1848:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On the night of the thirty-first of March, 1848, we found beyond
a shadow of a doubt or peradventure, that death had no power over the
spirit.... In a word, we found our so-called dead were all living."&mdash;<i>"Nineteenth

<p>Now the Scriptures teach plainly what these agencies in
Spiritualism are not, and what they are.</p>


<h4>What They Are Not</h4>

<p>They are not the spirits of the dead communicating messages
to the living.</p>

<p>In one of the earliest written portions of Holy Scripture,
the Lord declared plainly that the dead have no knowledge
of the living:</p>

<p>"He passeth: Thou changest his countenance, and sendest
him away. His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it
not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of
them." Job 14:20, 21.</p>

<p>The dead have no part in any communications with the
living on earth:</p>

<p>"Neither have they any more a portion forever in anything
that is done under the sun." Eccl. 9:6</p>


<h4>What They Are</h4>

<p>Already we have told what they are in quoting the warnings
of prophecy concerning the special deceptions of Satan
in the last days.</p>

<p>"The working of Satan with all power and signs and lying
wonders." 2 Thess. 2:9.</p>

<p>"Seducing spirits." 1 Tim. 4:1.</p>

<p>And as they were shown to the prophet John in a vision
of the very end, he declared:</p>

<p>"They are the spirits of devils, working miracles." Rev.
16:14.</p>

<p>These are the agencies through which come the supernatural
manifestations of Spiritualism. It is a terrible deception
that leads men and women to seek to satanic agencies,
supposing that they are communicating with the spirits of
their dead friends. Satan and his angels can readily simulate
the personality of the dead, and so deceive those who
disobey God in seeking to the dead for knowledge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>


<h4>The Climax of Deception</h4>

<p>That the marvels of Spiritualism would increase as the
end nears, was plainly taught by our Saviour in describing
the workings of Satan just before the second advent. He left
us the warning:</p>

<p>"Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ,
or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs,
and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders;
insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very
elect." Matt. 24:23, 24.</p>

<p>Evidently, then, by the miracle-working power that he
possesses, Satan will work mighty deceptions through both
human and supernatural agencies. And the crowning deception
will be his own manifestation as the Promised One,
simulating Christ's second coming. But the power and glory
that will fill all earth and the heavens at Christ's coming,
cannot be copied by Satan, with all his miracle-working skill.
That is why it is so important that we understand the Bible
teaching as to the nature and manner of Christ's second advent.
The doctrine of the silent, secret, mystical coming is
all abroad in the world, the teaching exactly calculated to
prepare the way for Satan's purposes of deception. Therefore
Christ forewarns us:</p>

<p>"Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore if they shall
say unto you, Behold, He is in the desert; go not forth: behold,
He is in the secret chambers; believe it not. For as
the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto
the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be."
Matt. 24:25-27.</p>

<p>The teachings of ancient theosophy and spiritualism&mdash;the
mysticism of the East&mdash;have been permeating Christendom
in recent years. Mme. Jean Delaire, writing in a London
review, said some years ago:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"India has apparently still a mission to fulfil, for her thought is slowly
beginning to mold the thought of Europe and of America; our keenest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
minds are today studying her philosophy; our New Theology is founded
upon the old, old Vedanta."&mdash;<i>National Review, September, 1908, p. 131.</i></p></div>

<p>This flood of ancient spiritualism from the East has come
about according to Isaiah's prophecy of things that were to
"come to pass in the latter days:"</p>

<p>"Thou hast forsaken Thy people the house of Jacob, because
they are filled with customs from the East, and are
soothsayers like the Philistines." Isa. 2:6, A.R.V.</p>

<p>In 1909 one of the leading representatives of theosophical
thought, Mrs. Annie Besant, of India, toured America with
the message of a coming messiah. She announced:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My message is very simple: 'Prepare for the coming Christ.' We
stand at the cradle of a new subrace, and each race or subrace has its
own messiah. Hermes is followed by Zoroaster; Zoroaster by Orpheus;
Orpheus by Buddha; Buddha by Christ. We now await with confidence
a manifestation of the Supreme Teacher of the world, who was last manifested
in Palestine. Everywhere in the West, not less than in the East,
the heart of man is throbbing with the glad expectation of the new avatar."</p></div>

<p>The leaven of the spiritualistic philosophy has been working
its way through Christendom during this generation. We
see clearly that the evil one is preparing the way for his final
work of deception.</p>

<h3>MAN'S NATURE AND STATE IN DEATH</h3>


<p>A wide-open door for Spiritualism is afforded by the
teaching that man has life in himself&mdash;immortality by nature;
and that death is not really death, but another form
of life.</p>

<p>The Scriptures close this door of false hope, teaching us
that man is mortal, that death is really death, and that
immortality is the gift of God through Christ by the resurrection
from the dead.</p>

<p>Clearly and definitely the Bible teaches that God only
has immortality, styling Him "the blessed and only Potentate,
the King of kings, and Lord of lords; who only hath
immortality." 1 Tim. 6:15, 16.</p>

<p>This scripture disposes of every idea that man is immortal
by nature, and opens the way for a consideration of the
Scripture teaching concerning man's nature, his state in
death, and the promise of life and immortality in Christ.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>


<h4>Man by Nature Mortal</h4>

<p>The word "mortal," as used in that ancient question by
Eliphaz, describes man's nature:</p>

<p>"Shall mortal man be more just than God?" Job 4:17.</p>

<p>In the creation, life was conditional upon the creature's
relation to Christ the Creator, in whom all things consist:</p>

<p>"All things were made by Him; and without Him was not
anything made that was made. In Him was life." John 1:3,4.</p>

<p>He was, and is, as the psalmist says, "the fountain of life."
Cut off from vital connection with Him, there could be no continuance
of life. The Lord warned Adam that his life was
conditional upon obedience. "In the day that thou eatest
thereof," He said of the forbidden tree, "thou shalt surely
die." Gen. 2:17. It was a declaration that man was not
immortal, but was dependent upon God for life.</p>

<p>When by unbelief and sin man rejected God, the sentence&mdash;death
eternal&mdash;must have been executed had not the plan
of salvation intervened. But as the stroke of divine justice
was falling upon the sinner, the Son of God interposed Himself
and received the blow. "He was bruised for our iniquities."
In the divine plan, the great sacrifice for man was
as sure then as when, later, it was actually made on Calvary.
Christ was "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world."</p>

<p>And there Adam, the sinner, now with a fallen human
nature, which would be perpetuated in his descendants in
all subsequent time, was granted an extension of life, every
moment of which, whether for him or for his posterity, was
the purchase of Christ by His own death, in order that in
this time of probation man might find forgiveness of sin
and assurance of life to come. Adam was not created immortal,
but was placed on probation, and had he continued
faithful, the gift of immortality must have been given him
at some later time, after he had passed the test. As the
original plan is carried out through Christ, "the second Adam,"
the gift of immortality is bestowed finally upon all who pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
the test of the judgment and are found in Christ, in whom
alone is life.</p>

<p>Having fallen, Adam, now possessed of a sinful nature, must
die. "The wages of sin is death." Rom. 6:23. It was impossible
that sin or sinners should be immortalized in God's
universe. So, inasmuch as the tree of life in Eden had been
made the channel of continuance of life to man, the Lord said:</p>

<p>"Now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the
tree of life, and eat, and live forever: therefore the Lord God
sent him forth from the garden of Eden." Gen. 3:22, 23.</p>

<p>This negatives the idea that there could ever be an immortal
sinner, who should mar God's creation forever. Sin
works out nothing but death. "Sin, when it is finished, bringeth
forth death." James 1:15. Fallen himself, Adam could
bequeath to his posterity only a fallen, mortal nature. So
began the sad history summed up in the text:</p>

<p>"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world,
and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that
all have sinned." Rom. 5:12.</p>


<h4>Mortality Universal</h4>

<p>Mortality is written upon all creation. Ages ago the wise
man wrote, "There is one event unto all: ... they go to the
dead." Eccl. 9:3. Human hearts everywhere and in all
time have cried out against the remorselessness of the great
enemy. "Do people die with you?" was the question met by
Livingstone in the untraveled wilds of Africa. "Have you no
charm against death?" The Greek as well as the barbarian
confessed to the helplessness of man before the great enemy.
Centuries before Christ, Sophocles the Athenian wrote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wonders are many! and none is there greater than man, who<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steers his ship over the sea, driven on by the south wind,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Shelters to ward off the arrows of rain, and to temper<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Stratagem hath he for all that comes! Never the future<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Finds him resourceless! Deftly he combats grievous diseases,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft from their grip doth he free himself. Death alone vainly&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vainly he seeks to escape; 'gainst death he is helpless."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>Chorus from Antigone.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What unspeakable pathos in the cry of humanity's helplessness
before death, the great enemy! But when Adam
went out of Eden, it was with the assurance of life from the
dead through the promised Seed, if faithful. It is the message
of the one gospel for all time&mdash;everlasting life in Christ.</p>

<h4>When Immortality is Bestowed</h4>

<p>Christ said, "I am the resurrection, and the life: he that
believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live."
John 11:25.</p>

<p>He has turned death, that would have been eternal, into a
little time of sleep, from which he will awaken the believer.
In the resurrection of the last day immortality is bestowed,
"in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be
raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this
corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must
put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have
put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality,
then shall be brought to pass the saying that is
written, Death is swallowed up in victory." 1 Cor. 15:52-54.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There is a blessed hope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More precious and more bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than all the joyless mockery<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And sheds a peaceful radiance o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prospects of the tomb."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Not until the resurrection, "at the last trump," is immortality
conferred upon the redeemed. Note that it is not
something immortal putting on immortality; but this "mortal"
puts on immortality. Mark this: there is no life after
death, save by the resurrection. "If there be no resurrection
of the dead,... then they also which are fallen asleep in
Christ are perished." 1 Cor. 15:13-18.</p>

<p>This resurrection, as stated by the apostle Paul, is not at
death, but in the last day, when Christ shall come, and all
His children that are in their graves shall hear His voice.
Jesus says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is the will of Him that sent Me, that every one
which seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, may have everlasting
life: and I will raise him up at the last day." John 6:40.</p>

<p>That is why the coming of Christ has been the "blessed
hope" of all the ages.</p>


<h4>Man's State in Death</h4>

<p>Between death and the resurrection, the dead sleep. Jesus
declares that death is a sleep. Lazarus was dead, but Jesus
said, "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth." John 11:11. It is the
language of Inspiration throughout. The patriarch Job said:</p>

<p>"Man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the
ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea,
and the flood decayeth and drieth up: so man lieth down,
and riseth not: till the heavens be no more [the heavens will
be rolled back as a scroll at Christ's coming], they shall not
awake, nor be raised out of their sleep." Job 14:10-12.</p>

<p>This hope of the resurrection at the last day was no indistinct
hope to the believer in God's promises. The patriarch
continued:</p>

<p>"If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed
time will I wait, till my change come. Thou shalt
call, and I will answer thee: Thou wilt have a desire to the
work of Thine hands." Verses 14, 15.</p>

<p>Job tells us of the place of his waiting for the Life-giver's
call: "If I wait, the grave is mine house." Job 17:13. It is
thence that Christ will call His own when He comes. "The
hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves
shall hear His voice, and shall come forth." John 5:28, 29.</p>

<p>Death is an unconscious sleep. It must of necessity be
so; for death is the opposite of life. Therefore there is no consciousness
of the passing of time to those who sleep in the
grave. It is as if the eyes closed in death one instant, and
the next instant, to the believer's consciousness, he awakens
to hear the animating voice of Jesus calling him to glad immortality,
and to see the angels catching up his loved ones
to meet Jesus in the air.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>These scriptures, out of many, will suffice to show that
man is not conscious in death:</p>

<p>"His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in
that very day his thoughts perish." Ps. 146:4.</p>

<p>"The living know that they shall die: but the dead know
not anything.... Also their love, and their hatred, and their
envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion
forever in anything that is done under the sun." Eccl. 9:5, 6.</p>

<p>Death is a sleep, which will continue until the resurrection.
Then the Lord will bring forth from the dust the same
person who was laid away in death.</p>

<p>Some have said that this Bible doctrine of the sleep of the
dead until the resurrection is a gloomy one. Popular tradition
thinks of the blessed dead as going at once to heaven,
which, say some, is a beautiful thought. But they forget
that the same teaching consigns their unbelieving friends to
immediate torment&mdash;and that, too, while awaiting the judgment
of the last day.</p>

<p>No; the Bible teaching is the cheering doctrine, the "blessed
hope." All the faithful of all the ages are going into the
kingdom together. This blessed truth appeals to the spirit
that loves to wait and share joys and good things with loved
ones. Of the faithful of past ages the apostle says:</p>

<p>"These all, having obtained a good report through faith,
received not the promise: God having provided some better
thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect."
Heb. 11:39, 40.</p>

<p>They are waiting, that all together the saved may enter
in. And the time of waiting is but an instant to those who
"sleep in Jesus."</p>

<p>David was a man of God, but the apostle Peter, speaking
by the Spirit on the day of Pentecost, declared to the people
of the city of David: "He is both dead and buried, and his
sepulcher is with us unto this day.... For David is not
ascended into the heavens." Acts 2:29-34. They without
us have not been made perfect. They are all awaiting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
that glad day toward which the apostle Paul turned the last
look of his mortal vision:</p>

<p>"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course,
I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid up for me a
crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge,
shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all
them also that love his appearing." 2 Tim. 4:7, 8.</p>

<p>What joy in that day to march in through the gates into
the eternal city, with Adam, and Abel, and Noah, and Abraham,
and Paul, and all the faithful, and the loved ones of our
own home circles, and dear comrades in service, every one
clothed with immortality, the gift of God in Christ Jesus our
Redeemer! Horatius Bonar's hymn sings the joyful hope as
the loved are laid away to "sleep in Jesus:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Softly within that peaceful resting place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We lay their wearied limbs, and bid the clay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Press lightly on them till the night be past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the far east give note of coming day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The shout is heard, the Archangel's voice goes forth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trumpet sounds, the dead awake and sing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The living put on glory; one glad band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hasten up to meet their coming King."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a word, the Scripture teaches that God alone has immortality,
that man is mortal, that death is a sleep, that life
after death comes only by the resurrection of the last day,
that the righteous are then given immortality. Further, the
Scripture teaches that later there will be a resurrection of the
unjust, not unto life, but unto death, the second death, from
which there is no release.</p>

<p>Every doctrine of Scripture and of the gospel is in accord
with this Bible teaching as to man's nature and his state in
death. But the traditional view of the natural immortality
of the soul and of life in death, nullifies the Bible doctrines
of life only in Christ, and the resurrection, and the judgment,
and the giving of rewards at Christ's coming, and the final
judgment upon the wicked and its execution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>


<h4>A Few Questions Briefly Considered</h4>

<p><i>1. The "Living Soul"</i></p>

<p>Says one, "Did not the Lord put into man an immortal
soul?"</p>

<p>No; the Scripture says:</p>

<p>"The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground,
and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became
a living soul." Gen. 2:7.</p>

<p>The soul was not put into the man, but when the life-giving
breath was breathed into his nostrils, the man himself
became a living soul, a living being. The ordinary version
(King James) gives "a living soul" in the margin of Gen. 1:30,
showing that the same expression is used of all the animal
creation in the Hebrew text. The famous Methodist commentator,
Dr. Adam Clarke, says on this phrase, "living
soul:"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A general term to express all creatures endued with animal life, in
any of its infinitely varied gradations."</p></div>

<p><i>2. Are "Soul" and "Spirit" Deathless?</i></p>

<p>"Are not the soul and spirit said to be deathless?" questions
another.</p>

<p>No. One writer says of the Scriptural use of the words
"soul" and "spirit:"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Hebrew and Greek words from which they are translated, occur
in the Bible, as we have seen, seventeen hundred times. Surely, once at
least in that long list we shall be told that the soul is immortal, if this is
its high prerogative. Seventeen hundred times we inquire if the soul is
once said to be immortal, or the spirit deathless. And the invariable
and overwhelming response we meet is, <i>Not once!"</i>&mdash;<i>"Here and Hereafter"
by U. Smith, p. 65.</i></p></div>

<p>On the contrary, the Lord declares, "The soul that sinneth,
it shall die." Eze. 18:20. It means that the person
who sins shall die; for the words "soul," "mind," "heart,"
and "spirit" are used to express life or the seat of the affections
or of the intellect. One may commend his soul to God, or his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
spirit to God (really his life into the keeping of God), until
the great day of the resurrection. The word "soul" is used
of all animal life in New Testament usage, as well as in the
Old; as, "Every living soul died in the sea." Rev. 16:3.</p>

<p><i>3. The Thief on the Cross</i></p>

<p>"Did not Christ promise the thief on the cross that he
would be with Him that day in Paradise?"</p>

<p>No; for Paradise is where God's throne is, and the tree of
life, and the city of God, the capital of Christ's kingdom;
and three days later Christ had not yet ascended to the Father.
"Touch Me not," He said to Mary after His resurrection;
"for I am not yet ascended to My Father." John 20:17.
The dying thief, therefore, was not with Him in Paradise
three days before.</p>

<p>Nor did the thief's question suggest such a thought. His
faith grasped Christ's resurrection, the resurrection of His children,
and the coming kingdom; and that day on the cross,
in the moment of the deepest humiliation of the Son of God,
the repentant sinner cried, "Lord, remember me when Thou
comest into Thy kingdom." And the Saviour replied, "Verily
I say unto thee today"&mdash;this day, when the world scoffs and
the darkness presses upon Me, this day I say it&mdash;"shalt thou
be with Me in Paradise." Luke 23:42, 43.</p>

<p>The punctuation that makes it read, "Today shalt thou
be with Me in Paradise," is not a part of the sacred text, and
puts the Saviour's promise in contradiction with the facts
of the whole narrative and the teaching of Scripture.</p>

<p><i>4. The Rich Man and Lazarus</i></p>

<p>"Then there is the parable of the rich man and Lazarus,"
one says, "where Lazarus and Dives are talking, though dead&mdash;Lazarus
in Abraham's bosom and the rich man in torment."</p>

<p>But that is a parable; and no one can set the figures of a
parable against the facts of positive Scripture. In parables,
lessons are often taught by figurative language and imaginary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
scenes which could never be real, though the lesson is emphasized
the more forcefully.</p>

<p>In the parable of Judges 9, the trees are represented as
holding a council and talking with one another. No one
mistakes the lesson of the parable, or supposes that the trees
actually talked. So in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus,
the lesson is taught that uprightness in this life, even
though under deepest poverty, will be rewarded in the future
life; while uncharitable selfishness will surely bring one to
ruin and destruction.</p>

<p>In the face of the Bible teaching, no one can turn this
parable into actual narrative, representing that the saved
in glory are now looking over the battlements of heaven and
talking with the lost writhing before their eyes in agony amid
the flames of unending torment. This is not the picture
that the Scriptures give us of heaven, nor of the state of the
dead, nor of the time and circumstances of the final rewards
or punishments.</p>

</div>


<h2><a name="THE_END_OF_THE_WICKED" id="THE_END_OF_THE_WICKED"></a><b>THE END OF THE WICKED</b></h2>


<p>So soon as ever Lucifer introduced sin into heaven, it was
certain, in the righteousness and omnipotence of God, that
the day would come when sin would be blotted out of the
perfect creation. Inspiration tells us that a time of final
reckoning with sin was assured when Satan and a host of the
angels with him lifted up the standard of mysterious rebellion
against the law and harmony of heaven:</p>

<p>"The angels which kept not their first estate, but left their
own habitation, He hath reserved in everlasting chains under
darkness unto the judgment of the great day." Jude 6.</p>

<p>Punishment for sin is assured. By listening to Satan's
temptation, man became involved in sin. Then a divine
Saviour was provided, through whom every soul might escape
from the kingdom of darkness, and find salvation and
life. But it is inevitable that those who refuse the way of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
life and reject the salvation of God, must finally be involved
with Satan and sin in the day when sin is visited.</p>

<p>By Adam's sin, all his posterity inherited a sinful, dying
nature. "In Adam all die," the Scripture says. But not a
soul in the last day can plead Adam's sin and the inheritance
of a fallen nature as an excuse for his own transgressions. By
Christ's gift of His life for us, the sinner, with all his weaknesses,
may become a partaker of the divine nature, and escape
the power of the fleshly nature. By virtue of Christ's
death for all, all recover from the death they die in Adam&mdash;the
first death. All have a resurrection, the unjust as well as
the just; and then every one gives account of himself to God,
according to his own life and the use he has made of the light
given him of God.</p>


<h4>The Two Resurrections</h4>

<p>The Scriptures emphasize the fact that there are to be
two resurrections. Paul, before Felix, declared his belief the
same as that of all the prophets,&mdash;"that there shall be a resurrection
of the dead, both of the just and unjust." Acts 24:15.</p>

<p>Jesus declared it in these words:</p>

<p>"The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the
graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that
have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that
have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation." John
5:28, 29.</p>

<p>The first resurrection is that of the just, at Christ's second
coming. It is written of this:</p>

<p>"Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection:
on such the second death hath no power, but they
shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with
Him a thousand years." Rev. 20:6.</p>

<p>After this, the righteous return with Christ to heaven,
and remain there during the thousand years. The wicked
living at the time of His coming are slain by the consuming
glory of His presence; and they, with all the unjust of all the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
ages, await in the grave the second resurrection, at the end
of the thousand years.</p>

<p>"The rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
years were finished." Rev. 20:5.</p>

<p>At the end of the thousand years the city of God, with
the saved, comes down out of heaven and settles upon the
earth.</p>

<p>Then the wicked are raised&mdash;the second resurrection.
Under Satan's leadership they march up to attack the city
of God. How naturally, we infer, may Satan persuade the
lost that, after all, he was right when he declared to Adam,
"Ye shall not surely die." Here are all his servants of all
the ages&mdash;living. Why may they not be immortal, beyond
the power of God to destroy? The old battle that began in
heaven is on again. Satan, the archrebel, marshals his hosts
of fallen angels and the myriads of fallen men, his legions
stretching wide over the earth.</p>

<p>"They went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed
the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire
came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."
Rev. 20:9.</p>

<p>"This is the second death," the Scripture says. Verse 14.
The great day has come when the sinner receives his wages&mdash;death&mdash;and
sin is destroyed.</p>


<h4>The Punishment Everlasting</h4>

<p>"The wages of sin is death." And the second death is
everlasting. There is no resurrection from this death. The
Scriptures describe it in terms that affirm utter destruction,
resulting in nonexistence.</p>

<p>"Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from
the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power."
2 Thess. 1:9.</p>

<p>"Behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and
all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble:
and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch."
Mal. 4:1.</p>

<p>"They shall be ashes," the third verse of this chapter
says. Every expression possible to language is employed to
denote utter destruction, everlasting death. That means nonexistence.
Sin and sinners are blotted out. The prophet
Obadiah, speaking of the visitation upon the heathen&mdash;the
unbelieving&mdash;in "the day of the Lord," says:</p>

<p>"They shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they
shall be as though they had not been." Verse 16.</p>

<p>This is the utter end of sin and all sinners, and of the author
of sin. Root and branch they are gone, "as though
they had not been." All this is in the description of the last
judgment, so fully set forth in the twentieth chapter of Revelation.</p>

<p>"Death and hell [<i>hades</i>, the grave] were cast into the lake
of fire. This is the second death." Rev. 20:14. Death and
the prison house of death are gone forever. Sin is wiped
out of a perfect universe, and not even a trace will remain of
the place of the fiery judgment.</p>

<p>"Yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea,
thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be."
Ps. 37:10.</p>

<p>The fires of the last day purify the earth, which comes
forth in Eden-like beauty. In the whole creation of God
there is no sin, no sinner, but all is harmonious again, as before
sin entered the universe. The prophet was given a view
of this glorious consummation, and the triumph of the Son
of God over sin.</p>

<p>"Every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth,
and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that
are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory,
and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto
the Lamb forever and ever." Rev. 5:13.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>


<h4>Some Opinions Briefly Considered</h4>

<p>The doctrine of the immortality, the indestructibility, of
the soul is responsible for the traditional view that the wicked
are kept alive in unending misery through all eternity. How
different this picture from that which Holy Scripture gives
of the second death! Terrible and awful it is, but it results
in the utter destruction of sin and sinners, leaving a clean
universe. The doctrine of the immortality of the soul came
in from pagan philosophy. Herodotus, "the father of history,"
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Egyptians ... were also the first to broach the opinion, that
the soul of man is immortal."&mdash;<i>Book 2, par. 123.</i></p></div>

<p>Evidently, they passed the doctrine on to the Greeks. Its
origin was in the words of Satan in Eden, "Ye shall not surely
die." The pagans had their nether world of spirits, or their
transmigration of souls with its ceaseless round from body to
body, and the Roman Catholics their purgatory with its purifying
fires. From these sources and not from the Word of
God, the traditional view has come into modern Christendom,
representing the Lord as unable or unwilling to end sin,
but keeping the sinner alive throughout eternity, to suffer
torture that can bring no remedy. The Scripture teaching
is far otherwise. However, there are certain Scripture phrases
that emphasize the severity of the punishment of sin, which
are often taken as supporting the doctrine of never-ending
conscious torment.</p>

<p><i>1. "Forever and Ever."</i>&mdash;In Rev. 20:10 it is said that
the devil and his chief agencies "shall be tormented day and
night forever and ever." The phrase emphasizes the surety
of their utter destruction.</p>

<p>"Forever" means age-lasting, or life-lasting&mdash;so long as a
thing exists by its nature. Thus in Ex. 21:6 the servant who
loved his master and did not wish to leave his service was to
have his ear pierced, "and he shall serve him forever," that
is, without release as long as he lives. So the fiery judgment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
of that last day holds the wicked until life ends; there is no
release until life is consumed.</p>

<p><i>2. "Everlasting Punishment."</i>&mdash;"These shall go away into
everlasting punishment." Matt. 25:46. It is everlasting
punishment, not everlasting punishing. The punishment is
everlasting death&mdash;"who shall be punished with everlasting
destruction." 2 Thess. 1:9.</p>

<p>The truth of the utter destruction of sinners is awful
enough, but it commends itself to every thought of justice
and mercy; for sin must be cleansed from a perfect universe.
But the unscriptural view of everlasting conscious torment
that never reaches the point of full punishment, is unthinkable.
Yet it is urged as a doctrine, and contended for as
vital to Christianity.</p>

<p>The following description is taken from a book written
for children, entitled "The Sight of Hell." It is printed in
Dublin&mdash;for children.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Little child, if you go to hell, there will be a devil at your side to
strike you. He will go on striking you every day, forever and ever, without
ever stopping. The first stroke will make your body as bad as Job's,
covered from head to foot with sores and ulcers. The second stroke will
make your body twice as bad as the body of Job.... How then will
your body be after the devil has been striking it every moment for a hundred
million years without stopping?"&mdash;<i>Quoted in the London Present
Truth, April 30, 1914.</i></p></div>

<p>What a relief to turn from this to the Bible doctrine of
the "everlasting destruction" of the second death, terrible
though it be!</p>

<p><i>3. "Everlasting Fire," "Eternal Fire," "Unquenchable Fire."</i>&mdash;All
these expressions are used in describing the fiery judgment
upon sin and sinners. The effect of the fire is everlasting
and eternal, and by a common usage in language the
adjective that describes the effect is applied to the agent by
which the effect is wrought.</p>

<p>A specific example of everlasting fire in the punishment of
evil is given in Scripture. Sodom and Gomorrah, those wicked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
"cities of the plain," were destroyed by a rain of fire from
heaven. These cities, Inspiration says, "are set forth for an
example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire." Jude 7. The
fire was everlasting, eternal, in its effects. The cities of the
plain were everlastingly consumed. But the fire went out
when the destruction was complete. Unquenchable fire is
fire that cannot be quenched. It consumes utterly, until nothing
is left; then it goes out of its own accord.</p>

<p><i>4. "Where Their Worm Dieth Not."</i>&mdash;Jesus warned of the
certain destruction of sin and sinners in the fire of Gehenna;
for this is the word translated "hell" in Mark 9:43.</p>

<p>Hades, which is often translated "hell," is the grave,
not the place of punishment. Gehenna, here used of the
place of punishment, was the name of the valley where the
refuse of Jerusalem was cast for burning. The map of Jerusalem,
in any ordinary Bible with maps, shows just outside
the southern wall a gorge marked "Valley of Hinnom" (Gehenna).
It was here that the people, in the olden times, had
sacrificed their children to Moloch.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In order to put an end to these abominations, Josiah polluted it with
human bones and other corruptions. 2 Kings 23:10, 13, 14."&mdash;<i>Hastings's
"Dictionary of the Bible."</i></p></div>

<p>Here the fires consumed the refuse, and the fire and worms
utterly destroyed the carcasses of beasts flung into the place
of destruction. It was regarded as a place accursed, and the
smoldering fires became symbolical of the fires of the judgment.</p>

<p>The use of this illustration, instead of arguing that the
wicked are never destroyed but always live, conveys the opposite
idea. What went into the fires of Gehenna was utterly
consumed, nothing being left. This was used by Christ as a
figure illustrative of the utter destruction of the unrepentant
sinner in the day of visitation.</p>

<p>This must suffice. The positive teaching of Holy Scripture
is that sin and sinners will be blotted out of existence.
There will be a clean universe again when the great controversy
between Christ and Satan is ended.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2><a name="ANGELS_THEIR_MINISTRY" id="ANGELS_THEIR_MINISTRY"></a>ANGELS: THEIR MINISTRY</h2>


<p>The one verse of Scripture which, perhaps, most comprehensively
sums up the ministry of the angels of God, is
this:</p>

<p>"Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister
for them who shall be heirs of salvation?" Heb. 1:14.</p>

<p>This scripture shows us how truly all heaven is engaged
in working for the salvation of this poor world, which has
wandered from the fold of God. It will surely be a time of
rejoicing among all the angelic host when Christ, the Good
Shepherd, brings back this lost world, cleansed from sin, once
more to the fold of God's perfect creation.</p>

<p>The angels rejoiced when this world was created. The
Lord said to Job:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the
earth?... when the morning stars sang together, and all
the sons of God shouted for joy?" Job 38:4-7.</p>

<p>Before ever this world was created, or man upon it, the
angels had been created by the eternal Son, in whom all things
consist. For angels are not redeemed men, neither will the
redeemed in the world to come ever become angels. Angels
are a different order of beings from men, a higher order in
creation. We read:</p>

<p>"What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? or the son
of man, that Thou visitest him? Thou madest him a little
lower than the angels; Thou crownedst him with glory and
honor." Heb. 2:6, 7.</p>

<p>In the life to come, by the wondrous power of Christ's
transforming grace, redeemed men are to be made equal to
the angels, as Christ stated:</p>

<p>"Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto
the angels; and are the children of God, being the children
of the resurrection." Luke 20:36.</p>

<p>This lifting of sinful man to an equality with the angels,
at least in the possession of life and immortality, is an illustration
of the gospel principle, "Where sin abounded, grace
did much more abound." Rom. 5:20. But the declaration
of equality with angels is a denial of identity with angels.
Angels existed before man, and redeemed man will still be
man, distinct from the angelic order, though the associate
of angels in the service of God.</p>


<h4>Attendants at the Throne of God</h4>

<p>When the prophet Isaiah was given a view of the heavenly
temple, he saw different orders of angels attending the throne
of God:</p>

<p>"I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted
up, and His train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphim:
each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face,
and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is
the Lord of hosts." Isa. 6:1-3.</p>

<p>Ezekiel beheld them in glory, attending the moving throne
of the Almighty. "The living creatures ran and returned as
the appearance of a flash of lightning." Eze. 1:14.</p>

<p>Daniel beheld the angelic host gathered in the most holy
place of the temple above, as the time came for the opening
of the work of the investigative judgment, the cleansing of
the sanctuary. Seeing the throne of God set for this final
work of Christ's ministry, the prophet says:</p>

<p>"Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand
times ten thousand stood before Him: the judgment
was set, and the books were opened." Dan. 7:10.</p>


<h4>God's Messengers</h4>

<p>The word "angel" means messenger. To and fro these
angelic messengers have gone in the service of their Creator.
A view of their ever-watchful service is given in the words
of the psalmist:</p>

<p>"Bless the Lord, ye His angels, that excel in strength,
that do His commandments, hearkening unto the voice of
His word." Ps. 103:20.</p>


<h4>Bearers of Tidings</h4>

<p>They visited Abraham's tent with warning of Sodom's
overthrow. Genesis 18.</p>

<p>They visited Lot in the city, and urged him to get his
family out. Genesis 19.</p>

<p>As Jacob, in fear but repentance, was about to meet Esau,
whom he had deceived, "the angels of God met him." Genesis
32. "This is God's host," he said, and he knew that the
God of Abraham and Isaac, and his God, also, had not forsaken
him.</p>

<p>At a discouraging time in the history of Israel, an angel
appeared to Gideon, bringing the message, "The Lord is with
thee," and calling him to the work of delivering his people.
Judges 6.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>As Daniel's prayer reached heaven, even while he still
prayed, the angel Gabriel "being caused to fly swiftly,"
touched him, and said:</p>

<p>"O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and
understanding. At the beginning of thy supplications the
commandment came forth, and I am come to show thee."
Dan. 9:21-23.</p>

<p>So close is the communication between heaven and earth.</p>

<p>The gladdest tidings ever brought from heaven to earth
since the promise of the Deliverer to Adam in Eden, were
brought by angels to the shepherds of Bethlehem. First, one
angel appeared, saying:</p>

<p>"I bring you good tidings of great joy.... For unto you
is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ
the Lord."</p>

<p>Such tidings to earth could never be the mission of one
lone angel, when all heaven longed to cry the news to a lost
world.</p>

<p>"And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of
the heavenly host praising God, and saying, Glory to God
in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men."
Luke 2:13, 14.</p>


<h4>Unseen in Halls of Government</h4>

<p>One incident related in the book of Daniel draws aside the
curtain, and shows how angels doubtless often have worked
unseen in kingly courts or halls of legislation. Daniel had
prayed for three weeks for light in certain matters that the
angel Gabriel had begun to unfold to him. When at last
the angel came, overpowering the prophet with the glory of
his presence, it was with a statement, first, of the reason for
the delay in responding to his prayer. The angel said:</p>

<p>"From the first day that thou didst set thine heart to
understand, and to chasten thyself before thy God, thy words
were heard, and I am come for thy words. But the prince
of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me;
and I remained there with the kings of Persia. Now I am
come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people
in the latter days." Dan. 10:12-14.</p>


<h4>Messengers of Deliverance</h4>

<p>The story of deliverance wrought by angels is too long to
tell. One need only think of the angels' taking slow-moving
Lot by the arms and setting him out of Sodom (Genesis 19);
of the angel finding Elijah under a bush in the desert, and
first baking a cake for the hungry man before speaking the
word to his discouraged heart (1 Kings 19); of Elisha praying
that the young man's eyes might be opened to see that there
were more angels with them round about than all the Syrians
encamped against them:</p>

<p>"The Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he
saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots
of fire round about Elisha." 2 Kings 6:17.</p>

<p>An angel shut the mouths of the lions when Daniel was
cast into their den. Daniel 6. An angel smote off Peter's
irons in the prison at Jerusalem, opened the doors, and led him
forth. Acts 12. Amid the angry waves sweeping over the
foundering ship in the Adriatic, Paul the apostle bade the
despairing crew be of good courage, "for there stood by me
this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
saying, Fear not." Acts 27:23, 24.</p>

<p>All through the ages, the angels of God have been standing
by. Daniel, and Peter, and Paul are dead; but the angels
still live. "Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to
minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?" Heb. 1:14.</p>


<h4>Guardian Angels</h4>

<p>That means that every child of God is under the guardianship
of the angels. "The angel of the Lord encampeth
round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them."
Ps. 34:7.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>Thank God, we are never left alone. Every child of God
has a guardian angel commissioned by the loving Father to
watch over him. Christ said:</p>

<p>"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones;
for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold
the face of My Father which is in heaven." Matt. 18:10.</p>

<p>This does not mean that trials never will come, or troubles.
In the midst of the trial, the angel of the Lord will stand by
to strengthen and to bring help from the God of all comfort.
It was in the midst of the fiery furnace that the "form of
the Fourth" appeared, walking with the three Hebrew children&mdash;Jesus
Himself treading the fiery way with them. And
when Jesus, in the days of His flesh, was sinking under the
crushing burden in Gethsemane, "there appeared an angel
unto Him from heaven, strengthening Him." Luke 22:43.</p>

<p>Our Saviour, who knows the comforting power of angel
ministry, is the Captain of the heavenly host, and has commissioned
them all as ministering spirits to the heirs of salvation.</p>

<p>When He comes in glory for His people, Christ will have
"all the holy angels with Him." As the voice of Jesus
awakens His sleeping saints and they rise immortal from the
opened graves, "He shall send His angels,... and they
shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one
end of heaven to the other." Matt. 24:31.</p>

<p>The angels who have watched over the heirs of salvation
through all the ages, know where they are, and they know
how to gather them, with their loved ones, to meet the Lord.</p>

<p>The angels who rejoiced when the Lord laid the foundations
of the earth, who mourned when man fell, who have
all along been working with Christ, their leader, to rescue
the lost, will yet rejoice when the Lord brings home His own.
What a day will that be in heaven!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_TIME_OF_THE_END" id="THE_TIME_OF_THE_END"></a>THE TIME OF THE END</h2>


<p>"Thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book,
even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and
knowledge shall be increased." Dan. 12:4.</p>

<p>Thus the words of the angel, spoken nearly twenty-five
hundred years ago, announced the opening of a new era of
enlightenment when the latter days should come.</p>


<h4>The Time</h4>

<p>At the end of the long period of predicted tribulation of
the church&mdash;the twelve hundred and sixty years of Daniel's
prophecy&mdash;the world entered upon this era of "the time of
the end."</p>

<p>"They shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity,
and by spoil, many days.... And some of them of understanding
shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make
them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for
a time appointed." Dan. 11:33-35.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>In practically every outline of prophecy touching this
time, the events of the last days are represented as following
the end of the prophetic period of tribulation. Christ's prophecy
of Matthew 24 so declares. Our Saviour showed that
this period of tribulation, would be shortened, "for the elect's
sake," and that "immediately after the tribulation of those
days" the signs of the end would begin to appear.</p>

<p>Thus, while the full period of the twelve hundred and
sixty years ended amid the scenes of the French Revolution,
which gave the papal power a deadly wound in the last decade
of the eighteenth century, the shortening of the days of tribulation
had begun even earlier to spread increasing knowledge
and enlightenment over the earth.</p>


<h4>The Prophecy Unsealed</h4>

<p>The angel's words to Daniel were,</p>

<p>"Shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time
of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be
increased." Dan. 12:4.</p>

<p>"The words are closed up and sealed till the time of the
end." Verse 9.</p>

<p>This means that as the time of the end came, men would
be impelled to search diligently for light in the prophetic word.
Events taking place in fulfilment of the prophecy would be
recognized, and with the coming of the time there would come
the opening up, or unsealing, of the prophetic scriptures, with
their message for men in the last days.</p>

<p>As the time drew near, Bible students were led more and
more to search the word of prophecy. Sir Isaac Newton,
called "the greatest of philosophers," wrote of prophetic
study:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The giving ear to the prophets is a fundamental character of the
true church. For God has so ordered the prophecies, that in the latter
days 'the wise may understand, but the wicked shall do wickedly, and
none of the wicked shall understand.' Dan. 12:9, 10."&mdash;<i>"Observations
on the Prophecies of Daniel" (London, 1733), part 1, chap. 1.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, this man who had delved so deeply into the laws of
nature, but who bowed his heart in childlike faith to listen
to the voice of Inspiration, declared his hope that the time of
the end was near at hand in his day (he died in 1727). Of
this prophecy of the unsealing of the book he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'Tis therefore a part of this prophecy, that it should not be understood
before the last age of the world; and therefore it makes for the credit
of the prophecy that it is not yet understood. But if the last age, the age
of opening these things, be now approaching, as by the great successes of
late interpreters it seems to be, we have more encouragement than ever
to look into these things. If the general preaching of the gospel be
approaching,
it is to us and to our posterity that those words mainly belong:
In the time of the end the wise shall understand, but none of the wicked
shall understand.... 'Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear
the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written
therein.'"&mdash;<i>"Observations on the Apocalypse" (London, 1733), chap. 1.</i></p></div>

<p>True to the word of the angel, the events of the ending
of the twelve hundred and sixty years of papal supremacy,
amid the scenes of the French Revolution, drew the attention
of Bible students everywhere. It was seen that prophecy was
being fulfilled before men's eyes. It gave great impetus to
the study of the prophetic scriptures. The great historic
prophecies began to be opened up&mdash;unsealed&mdash;to the understanding.
An English historian of that period, John Adolphus,
though writing a secular history, remarks upon this awakening
interest in prophetic study:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The downfall of the papal government [in 1798], by whatever means
effected, excited perhaps less sympathy than that of any other in Europe:
the errors, the oppressions, the tyranny of Rome over the whole Christian
world, were remembered with bitterness; many rejoiced, through religious
antipathy, in the overthrow of a church which they considered as idolatrous,
though attended with the immediate triumph of infidelity; and
many saw in these events the accomplishment of prophecies, and the
exhibition of signs promised in the most mystical parts of the Holy
Scriptures."&mdash;<i>"History
of France from 1790 to 1802" (London, 1803),
Vol. II, p. 379.</i></p></div>

<p>From those tunes of fulfilling prophecy, there arose a
distinct movement, reviving the teaching of the doctrine of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Christ's second coming, and directly preparing the way for
the advent movement that was to come with the days of 1844,
when yet fuller light was to break forth from the unsealed
prophecies of the book of Daniel. Of the angel that symbolizes
the special gospel work for these last days, it is written,
"He had in his hand a little book open." Rev. 10:2. The
"time of the end" came, and with it has come the opening of
the sealed book. The "sure word of prophecy" speaks its
message full and clear to the ears of all mankind today.</p>


<h4>Increase of Knowledge</h4>

<p>"Many shall run to and fro," the prophecy said, "and
knowledge shall be increased." It is knowledge of the prophecy
and of the things of God that is primarily the topic; but
the era that we are discussing has been one of general enlightenment
and extension of knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> "The entrance of Thy
words giveth light," says the psalmist: and when the Reformation
of the sixteenth century broke the bands of age-long superstition
and error, and set free the Word of God, the way was
preparing for the coming of this wonderful era of the diffusion
of general knowledge.</p>

<p>The era of reform movement was an era of world exploration
and discovery. Diaz had founded the south African
cape, and Columbus had given to future generations the New
World. The result was voyage after voyage of discovery,
and then awakening, colonization, and expansion.</p>

<p>The famous and learned Francis Bacon, who died in 1626,
felt in his day that the time spoken of by Daniel's prophecy
was drawing near. He wrote:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Nor should the prophecy of Daniel be forgotten, touching the last
ages of the world: 'Many shall go to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased;'
clearly intimating that the thorough passage of the world (which
now by so many distant voyages seems to be accomplished, or in course
of accomplishment), and the advancement of the sciences, are destined
by fate, that is, by divine Providence, to meet in the same age."&mdash;<i>"Novum
Organum," book 1, xciii. (Bacon's Works, Spedding and Ellis, Vol. IV,
p. 92.)</i></p></div>

<p>When the time indicated in the prophecy fully came,
with the last decade of the eighteenth century, there was
witnessed the upspringing of movements that have wrought
mightily for the enlightenment and evangelization of the
world. As the events of the French Revolution announced
the closing of the long era of papal supremacy, so also another
series of events at the same time announced the opening of the
era of increasing knowledge. Speaking of these developments,
Lorimer, a Scottish writer, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"At the very time when Satan is hoping for, and the timid are fearing,
an utter overturn of true religion, there is a revival, and the gospel
expands its wings and prepares for a new flight. It is worthy of remembrance
that the year 1792, the very year of the French Revolution, was
also the year when the Baptist Missionary Society was formed, a society
which was followed during the succeeding, and they the worst, years of
the Revolution, with new societies of unwonted energy and union, all
aiming, and aiming successfully, at the propagation of the gospel of Christ,
both at home and abroad. What withering contempt did the great Head
of the church thus pour upon the schemes of infidels! And how did He
arouse the careless and instruct His own people, by alarming providences,
at a season when they greatly needed such a stimulus."&mdash;<i>"Historical
Sketches of the Protestant Church in France," p. 522.</i></p></div>

<p>Another writer, Dr. D.L. Leonard, historian of the century
of missions, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The closing years of the eighteenth century constitute in the history
of Protestant missions an epoch indeed, since they witnessed nothing less
than a revolution, a renaissance, an effectual and manifold ending of the
old, a substantial inauguration of the new. It was then that for the first
time since the apostolic period, occurred an outburst of general missionary
zeal and activity. Beginning in Great Britain, it soon spread to the
Continent and across the Atlantic. It was no mere push of fervor, but a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
mighty tide set in, which from that day to this has been steadily rising
and spreading."&mdash;<i>"A Hundred Years of Missions," p. 69.</i></p></div>

<p>The time of the prophecy had come, and the hand of providence
was bringing into being agencies that have spread
light and knowledge over all lands.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Look where the missionary's feet have trod&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flowers in the desert bloom; and fields, for God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are white to harvest. Skeptics may ignore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet on the conquering Word, from shore to shore,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And plains of Ind, where ceaseless summer smiles;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Remains;&mdash;they tell the love, attest the might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Him whose messengers across the wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To them salvation bore, hope, freedom gave."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>Horace D. Woolley.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The organization of foreign missionary enterprise was
quickly accompanied by the establishment of Bible societies
for a systematic work of translating and world-wide distribution
of the Scriptures. In 1804 the British and Foreign Bible
Society was organized. Students of the prophetic word felt
at the time that these agencies were coming in fulfilment of
the prophecy. One writer of those times said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The stupendous endeavors of one gigantic community to convey the
Scriptures in every language to every part of the globe may well deserve
to be considered as an eminent sign even of these eventful times. Unless
I be much mistaken, such endeavors are preparatory to the final grand
diffusion of Christianity, which is the theme of so many inspired prophets,
and which cannot be very far distant in the present day."&mdash;<i>G.S. Faber,
D.D., "Dissertation on the Prophecies," Vol. II, p. 406 (1844).</i></p></div>

<p>Now the Word of God, in whole or in part, is speaking in
more than five hundred languages, and it is estimated that
these tongues, at least in their spoken form, can make the
divine message comprehensible to ninety-five per cent of the
inhabitants of the earth.</p>

<p>The work of modern missions, that had its birth as the
time of the end came, is one of the great world factors today.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Nearly thirty million dollars a year are given for Protestant
missions, and a force of more than twenty thousand foreign
missionaries is in the field, not counting the many thousands
of native missionaries and helpers. Truly the time of the end
is proving to be an era of increasing light and knowledge.</p>


<h4>The Opening of All Lands</h4>

<p>As the time came for knowledge to be increased, it was
necessary that all lands should be open to receive the enlightening
agencies. Thus, as the time of the end came, we see distinctly
the hand of Providence swinging open the doors into
all countries. It has been an era of world survey and development.
Particularly is this true of the last sixty or seventy
years. It was in 1844 that the time referred to in the prophecy
came for the special advent movement, bearing the judgment-hour
message to the world. The range of the movement
is thus described in the prophecy:</p>

<p>"I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having
the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
people." Rev. 14:6.</p>

<p>This was a declaration that as the time came for the closing
gospel work to be done, the doors of access to every nation
and tongue and people would be thrown open. In 1844, or
but a few years before, much of the world was closed to missionary
endeavor; but as the prophecy indicates, the years
following have witnessed the swift and systematic opening
of all lands to the gospel message.</p>

<p>It was in 1842 that five treaty ports in China were opened
to commerce and to missions,&mdash;advance steps in the opening
of all China to the gospel. In 1844 Turkey was prevailed
upon to recognize the right of Moslems to become Christians,
reversing all Moslem tradition. In 1844 Allen Gardiner
established the South American Mission. In 1845 Livingstone's
determination was formed to open up the African interior.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. A.T. Pierson, speaking of the wonderful way in which
Providence opened the doors of access in those times, wrote
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Most countries shut out Christian missions by organized opposition,
so that to attempt to bear the good tidings was simply to dare death for
Christ's sake; the only welcome awaiting God's messengers was that of
cannibal ovens, merciless prisons, or martyr graves. But, as the little
band advanced, on every hand the walls of Jericho fell, and the iron gates
opened of their own accord. India, Siam, Burma, China, Japan, Turkey,
Africa, Mexico, South America, the Papal States, and Korea were successively
and successfully entered. Within five years, from 1853 to 1858,
new facilities were given to the entrance and occupation of seven different
countries, together embracing half the world's population."&mdash;<i>"Modern
Mission Century," p. 25.</i></p></div>

<span class="caption">INTO THE HEART OF
AFRICA<br />

The Victoria Falls railroad bridge

</div>

<p>God's providence has laid under tribute every force and
every resource for the opening of all lands&mdash;missionary endeavor,
love of adventure, commercial enterprise, and scientific
interest. Railways have been built through regions that
were undiscovered seventy years ago, and among the passengers
traveling now over the iron trail are men and women of
tribes unknown fifty years ago. But the gospel message was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
to go to every tribe and tongue before the end; and wonderfully
Providence has been opening the doors throughout all
this "time of the end," and particularly in our generation.</p>


<h4>Material Agencies for the Work</h4>

<p>The prophecy represents not only a world-wide work, but
a quick work in proclaiming the gospel message in the last
days. The movement is symbolized in the Revelation by an
angel flying in the midst of heaven, from land to land. And
as to the closing work, when the end is near at hand, the
Scripture says:</p>

<p>"He will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness:
because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth."
Rom. 9:28.</p>

<p>"Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith
the Lord of hosts." This is the hope for a quickly finished
work in all the earth in our time. Yet the Lord lays hold
of material things for service; and wonderfully the hand of
Providence has wrought in bringing into existence material
agencies for a quick work in carrying the gospel to the world&mdash;such
agencies as no generation before ours ever had.</p>

<p>Consider the marvelous facilities for world-travel. They
are the product of this time of the end. "Many shall run
to and fro," said the prophecy. Some interpreters have restricted
the Hebrew phrase to a "searching" to and fro for
knowledge. Even this would include a literal running to and
fro; for the light of increasing knowledge was to be diffused
over all the earth. But the best authority on the Hebrew
declares for the plain meaning of our English translation:
"Many shall run to and fro." In two recent works, Dr.
C.H.H. Wright, the English scholar, says of this text:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The natural meaning must be upheld, i.e., wandering to and fro."&mdash;<i>"Critical
Commentary on Daniel," p. 209.</i></p>

<p>"Why should not that expression be used in the sense in which it
is employed in Jeremiah 5:1, namely, of rapid movement hither and
thither?"&mdash;<i>"Daniel and His Prophecies," p. 321.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>At the time when the first foreign missionary movement
was being launched in America, Robert Fulton's steamship,
the "Clermont," was making its first trip on the Hudson.</p>

<p>In 1838 the first ships to cross the Atlantic under steam power
alone&mdash;the "Sirius" and the "Great Western"&mdash;came into
New York from Liverpool, a few hours apart, forerunners of
the fleets that furrow all the seas today, making quick pathways
for the gospel messengers to all lands. Verily, they are
a gift of God's providence to this generation, when all the
world is to hear the gospel message.</p>

<p>In 1825 Stephenson built his first railway passenger locomotive,
which may still be seen in the Darlington railway
station, in England. It was the beginning of the great revolution
in land travel. The late Prof. Alfred Russel Wallace,
scientist, wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"From the earliest historic and even prehistoric times till the construction
of our great railways in the second quarter of the present century
[the nineteenth], there had been absolutely no change in the methods of
human locomotion."&mdash;<i>"The Wonderful Century," p. 7.</i></p></div>

<p>For nearly six thousand years men had traveled in the
old way. Why should these revolutionary changes in travel
by sea and land come abruptly just at this time?&mdash;Because
the time foretold in the prophecy was at hand, when the last
gospel message was to be carried quickly to all the world&mdash;"to
every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people."
We see the hand of the living God opening the doors into all
lands, and His wonderful providence laying at the feet of
this generation agencies for quickly covering the whole earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>Later came the electric telegraph, for the quick transmission
of news. It was in 1837 that Cooke and Wheatstone
in England, and Morse in the United States, made their application
for patents on the electric telegraph. It was in 1844
that the first long-distance system was successfully demonstrated&mdash;when
the historic message was sent from Baltimore
to Washington, "What hath God wrought!" Now news of
events fulfilling prophecy, and news of progress and conditions
in all lands, are daily spread before the world by this
agency of our wonderful time.</p>

<p>Some years ago a young man in Europe&mdash;a Seventh-day
Adventist&mdash;was giving answer for his faith. His conscience
would not allow him to do ordinary labor on God's holy Sabbath.
He had declared to the court that the oath of loyalty
which had been required of him forbade his breaking the
Sabbath. "How is that?" asked the judge. The young
man replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I was sworn in with a Christian oath, and therefore cannot be under
an obligation to violate the commandments of God and work on the Sabbath.
One must regard God as the highest authority, and obey Him
in the first place."</p></div>

<p>This witness was borne in a little courtroom, before a
small group of men; but the press dispatches took it up, and
the description of the scene and report of the words spoken
were carried by electric telegraph to the press of at least four
continents, and millions read the testimony of the young
man to the faith that was in him.</p>

<p>In the days to come, with great events taking place and
solemn issues calling upon men to make decision for God and
His truth, how quickly, in some great crisis, all the world
may be warned, and the last individual decisions be made
for eternity!</p>


<h4>Modern Printing</h4>

<p>The invention of the printer's art had come just in time
to give wings to Reformation truth. Luther said of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Printing is the latest and greatest gift by which God enables us to
advance the things of the gospel. It is the last bright flame, manifesting
itself just previous to the extinction of the world. Thanks be to God,
it came before the last day came."&mdash;<i>Michelet's "Life of Luther," p. 291.</i></p></div>

<p>While improvements in the art were made through the
centuries, it was a slow process, even up to the opening of
our generation. During our day, however, inventions have
revolutionized the printing process.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>In this, as in other things, the methods have been speeded
up to meet the necessities of this time of rapid accomplishment.
The printing press is one of the chief of the marvelous
enlightening agencies of this time of the end. By it the
printed pages of truth are set falling over the earth "like
the leaves of autumn."</p>

<p>Time fails us to speak of all the wonderful material developments
of our day, when knowledge has been increased, and
when men are not only searching to and fro, but literally running
to and fro. The whole earth is brought within the range
of human knowledge, and the light of saving truth is streaming
out toward every dark place where the children of men
dwell.</p>

<p>Nearly twenty-five hundred years ago it was written upon
the prophetic page,</p>

<p>"Shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time
of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall
be increased."</p>

<p>There the word stood on the scroll of prophecy through
more than two millenniums. Then, as the time of the end
came, lo, the book of prophecy was unsealed, and the new era
of increasing knowledge began to spread in wondrous blessing
over the earth.</p>

<p>So surely, also, the prophecies of the last events will be
accomplished. In the occurrences taking place before our
eyes, we see that God is indeed finishing His work in the
earth, and cutting it short in righteousness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

increased facilities for travel, all nations have been brought close together

<h2><a name="THE_EASTERN_QUESTION" id="THE_EASTERN_QUESTION"></a>THE EASTERN QUESTION</h2>

<h3>MODERN HISTORY IN THE LIGHT OF ANCIENT PROPHECY</h3>


<p>Not alone of the history of ancient nations does the "sure
word of prophecy" bear witness. Political events of our own
and coming days are described.</p>

<p>The nations of the latter day are pictured as preparing
war, gathering their forces for the great Armageddon, the
battle of the day of God.</p>

<p>As a signal of the last great struggle, the fall, or "drying
up," of the power ruling the territory watered by the river
Euphrates is foretold. Rev. 16:12. The Euphrates in all
modern history has been suggestive of the dominions of the
Turkish or Ottoman Empire. And Armageddon, designated
as the meeting place of armies in the last clash of nations, is
in Palestine, which, through all modern times, has been in
possession of the Turkish power.</p>

<p>The index finger of prophecy points, therefore, to this
region of the eastern Mediterranean as the pivotal point in
the closing history of nations; and with Turkey's fate is
wrapped up the fate of all the nations of the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>All this adds deepest and most solemn import to the study
of what is known as the Eastern Question, a question that
has been to the fore in international politics much of the time
throughout this generation. Wars have been fought over it,
cabinets have wrestled with it, and still it holds its place
in the first rank of living issues of today.</p>

<p>As every one knows, the Eastern Question involves the
dominion or supremacy in the Near East. This region was
a pivotal point in the struggles of the nations in ancient times&mdash;the
meeting place of East and West. Maspero, historian
of ancient empires, says of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Some countries seem destined from their origin to become the
battle fields of the contending nations.... The nations around are
eager for the possession of a country thus situated.... From remote
antiquity Syria was in the condition just described. By its position it
formed a kind of meeting place, where most of the military nations of
the ancient world were bound sooner or later to come violently into
collision."&mdash;<i>"Struggle of the Nations," chap. 1.</i></p></div>

<p>It is not strange, therefore, that one of the great outlines
of historic prophecy should deal with events centering around
this pivotal region. The prophecy of Daniel 11 does so,
outlining the course of history from ancient times to the
final solution of the Eastern Question amid the scenes of
the end.</p>


<h4>Rise and Fall of Ancient Empires</h4>

<p>The prophetic outline of Daniel 11 begins with Persia,
in the third year of Cyrus, the conqueror of Babylon. (See
Dan. 10:1.) The angel of God appeared to Daniel, and in
the longest and most detailed single prophecy in all the Bible,
told the story of events connected with this region of the
Near East for the centuries to come, until the end. Putting
the word of prophecy and the record of history side by side,
we see how exactly history has fulfilled prophecy; and we may
know certainly that the brief portion of the prophecy yet unfulfilled
will surely come to pass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>


<h4>Persia</h4>

<p><i>Prophecy.</i>&mdash;"Now will I show thee the truth. Behold,
there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth
shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through
his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia."
Dan. 11:2</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The three kings following Cyrus were (1) Cambyses,
(2) Smerdis, (3) Darius; the fourth, Xerxes, was "far
richer than they all." He had the treasures of his father, Darius,
who was called the "merchant" or "hoarder" by his
own people, and Xerxes gathered stores of wealth in addition.
When Xerxes was on his way to invade Grecia, a Lydian
named Pythius entertained the whole Persian army with
feasts, and offered to aid in bearing the expense of the campaign.
Xerxes asked who this man of such wealth was. He
was answered:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This is the man, O king! who gave thy father Darius the golden
plane tree, and likewise the golden vine; and he is still the wealthiest
man we know of in all the world, excepting thee."&mdash;<i>Herodotus, book 7,
par. 27.</i></p></div>

<p>"Richer than they all," Xerxes, "through his riches," was
able, as the prophecy had foretold, to "stir up all against the
realm of Grecia." Forty-nine nations marched under his banners
to the attack. The Greek poet, &AElig;schylus, who himself
fought against the Persians, wrote of Xerxes' mighty host,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And myriad-peopled Asia's king, a battle-eager lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From utmost east to utmost west sped on his countless horde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In unnumbered squadrons marching, in fleets of keels untold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing none dared disobey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For stern overseers were they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the godlike king begotten of the ancient race of Gold."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>"Pers&aelig;," Way's translation.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Xerxes boasted that he was leading "the whole race of
mankind to the destruction of Greece." But his invasion
ended in the total rout of his forces by land and by sea. It
was an advertisement to the world that Persia's might was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
broken. The prophecy treats it so, and deals no further with
Persian history.</p>

<p>&AElig;schylus at the time celebrated the passing of Persia's
prestige in the lines,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With sacred awe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Persian law<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more shall Asia's realms revere;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their lord's hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At his command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more the exacted tribute bear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Before the Ionian squadrons Persia flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sinks engulfed beneath the main;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fallen! fallen! is her imperial power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And conquest on her banners waits no more."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>"Pers&aelig;," Potter's translation.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The next great world change was to be the rise of Grecia
to dominion. So, although a number of kings followed
Xerxes in Persia, the prophecy passes from his disastrous
invasion directly to the coming of Grecia under its "mighty
king," Alexander the Great.</p>


<h4>Grecia</h4>

<p><i>Prophecy.</i>&mdash;"A mighty king shall stand up, that shall
rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. And
when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and
shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to
his posterity." Dan. 11:3, 4.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Alexander the Great stood up and ruled with
great dominion, over a kingdom stretching from India to
Grecia, with kings yet farther west sending embassies to
Babylon to make submission. But in the height of his power,
as the prophecy suggests, he was suddenly cut down by death.
All his posterity perished, and out of the struggles of his
generals for supremacy came (301 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) the division of
the empire toward "the four winds," as the prophecy had
declared so long before. Rawlinson, the historian, says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A quadripartite division of Alexander's dominion was recognized:
Macedonia [west], Egypt [south], Asia Minor [north], and Syria [stretching
eastward beyond the Euphrates]."&mdash;<i>"Sixth Monarchy," chap. 3.</i></p></div>


<h4>The Kings of the North and South</h4>

<p>Next, a rearrangement of these powers is noted; and it
is this that gives us the key to the study of the closing portion
of the long prophetic outline dealing with events of our own
day. The narrative continues:</p>

<p><i>Prophecy.</i>&mdash;"The king of the south shall be strong, and
one of his princes ... shall be strong above him;... his
dominion shall be a great dominion." Verse 5.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The history testifies that the king of the south
(Egypt, under Ptolemy) was strong; but one of the four
princes was "strong above him." Seleucus, of Syria and the
east, pushed his dominion northward, subduing most of Asia
Minor, and extending his boundary into Thrace, on the European
side, beyond the Dardanelles. Henceforward, as Mahaffy
says,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"there were three great kingdoms&mdash;Macedonia, Egypt, Syria&mdash;which
lasted, each under its own dynasty, till Rome swallowed them up."&mdash;<i>"Alexander's
Empire," p. 89.</i></p></div>

<p>Thus Seleucus took the territory of the north, and the
Syrian power became king of the north, its empire extending
from Thrace, in Europe, through Asia Minor to Syria and the
Euphrates. The seat of empire was removed from the east,
and Antioch, in northern Syria, "once the third city of the
world," became the famous capital.</p>

<p>The prophecy next foretold in remarkable detail the contests
between these two strong powers, the king of the north
(Syria and Asia Minor) and the king of the south (Egypt).
The conflict raged back and forth till the coming of the Romans.
The Holy Land was the frequent meeting place of
the contending armies. The Encyclopedia Britannica describes
it:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Palestine was as of old the battle field for the king of the north and
the king of the south.... The history of these times is lost in its
details."&mdash;<i>Ninth
edition, Vol. XV, art. "Macedonian Empire," p. 144.</i></p></div>

<p>We shall not follow the details of this contest as foretold
in the prophecy, nor yet the outline of events after the coming
of the Roman power ended the rivalry between Syria and
Egypt. It is necessary only that we fix the events and geographic
terms of this early portion of the prophecy. Then
we shall have the key to the closing portion, dealing with
events of the last days, when the king of the north again
appears.</p>


<h4>The Modern King of the North</h4>

<p>In the last verses of the chapter we find the king of the
north a chief actor in this same region, "at the time of the
end." Verse 40. And we are told that when this power
comes to its end, it is the signal that the great day of God is
at hand. (See Dan. 12:1.)</p>

<p>It becomes a vital question, therefore, what power in these
last days is the king of the north, whose end is the signal of
the swift ending of the world. Inspiration gives the basis
for the answer. The king of the north in the early portion of
the prophecy was the power that ruled in Syria and Asia
Minor, from the Euphrates to the shores of the Dardanelles.
The king of the north, then, of the later portion of the prophecy,
must be the power that has been ruling in this same
region during the time of the end.</p>

<p>What power has held dominion over this territory in
modern times?&mdash;The Turkish or Ottoman Empire. At this
time Turkey holds almost the identical dominion of the ancient
king of the north&mdash;from the Euphrates to the sea, and
northward over Asia Minor and the shores of the Dardanelles.</p>

<p>Then today Turkey is certainly the king of the north,
according to the prophecy of Daniel 11.</p>

<p>Of the later history of the king of the north and his end
and the events following it, the prophecy says:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble
him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy,
and utterly to make away many.</p>

<p>"And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between
the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to
his end, and none shall help him.</p>

<p>"And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great
Prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and
there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there
was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy
people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written
in the book." Dan. 11:44, 45; 12:1.</p>

</div>

<p>The opening verse of this scripture describes exactly the
history of Turkey in modern times. Turkey's disquietude
has come because of tidings out of the east and out of the
north. In both these directions there has been a pushing
back of the Turkish frontier, particularly in the north. Again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
and again, during this time of the end, Turkey has gone forth
with fury to resist these encroachments and prevent the loss
of territory.</p>

<p>The prophecy indicates that in some of these struggles
the king of the north will yet transfer his capital:</p>

<p>"He shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between
the seas in the glorious holy mountain."</p>


<h4>Removal to Jerusalem</h4>

<p>This prophecy can mean nothing else than that the king
of the north will eventually set up his headquarters in Jerusalem;
for Jerusalem is "the holy mountain" of the Scriptures.
Zech. 8:3.</p>

<p>It is a wise counsel that says, "Tread lightly in the details
of unfulfilled prophecy." Just how events are to turn, by
what route or processes the steps are to be taken, it is useless
to conjecture. But there the prophecy stands. Every
word of the early portion of the prophetic outline has been
fulfilled to the letter in the history of the ancient empires
battling century after century over this region. Every word
spoken of the final scenes will as certainly be fulfilled.</p>

<p>In view of this prophecy,&mdash;that Jerusalem is yet to be
made the headquarters of the king of the north,&mdash;it becomes
highly significant that the Mohammedans regard Jerusalem
as a sacred city. According to Mohammedan tradition, Jerusalem
is to play a leading part in the closing history of that
people. Hughes, in his "Dictionary of Islam," article "Jerusalem,"
summarizes the teaching:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the last days there will be a general flight to Jerusalem."</p></div>

<p>Speaking of Jerusalem, an old Arab commentator on the
Koran, Mukaddasi (<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 985), said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"As to the excellence of the city. Why, is not this to be the place
of marshaling on the day of judgment, where the gathering together and
the appointment will take place? Verily Makkah [Mecca] and Al Madina
have their superiority by reason of the Ka'abah and the prophet,&mdash;the
blessing of Allah be upon him and his family!&mdash;but, in truth, on the
day of judgment both cities will come to Jerusalem, and the excellencies
of them all will then be united."&mdash;<i>Le Strange, "Palestine under the Moslems,"
p. 85.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus Moslem doctrinal teaching and tradition both point
out Jerusalem as the rallying place of Moslems before the end.
Again and again in recent years, as the pressure has threatened
the Turkish hold on Constantinople, the thoughts of
Moslems have turned toward Jerusalem as a possible capital.
A few years ago a Seventh-day Adventist missionary in Constantinople
wrote to his home board:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Within the past few months quite a company of people from the
Transcaucasus district have come to Ismid,&mdash;old Nicodemia,&mdash;bringing
all they possess with them. Some of them possess considerable wealth.
When asked if they were going to settle in Ismid, they replied that they
would settle nowhere permanently at present. They stated that they
had come to be prepared to go with their leader when he left Constantinople
to go to Jerusalem."</p></div>

<p>Wherever the capital may first be set up following the
forsaking of Constantinople,&mdash;and Turkish authorities, we are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
told, have discussed a number of possible locations in Asia
Minor,&mdash;there stands the ancient prophecy as to the eventual
seat of the king of the north,</p>

<p>"He shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the
seas in the glorious holy mountain."</p>

<p>Following that, what comes? The prophecy declares,</p>

<p>"Yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him."</p>


<h4>What Comes When Turkey Falls</h4>

<p>The fury of his goings forth "utterly to make away many,"
the moving of his capital from one place to another, avail
nothing in the end. "He shall come to his end, and none
shall help him."</p>

<p>The suggestion of the prophecy is that this power has
hitherto been helped to stand. Here again every suggestion
of the prophetic language finds its response in history.
Through these later years of the time of the end the Ottoman
Empire has been helped to stand, by either one power or
another, or by some combination of powers. The late Lord
Salisbury, while premier of Britain, thus stated the reasons for
this policy of helping Turkey:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Turkey is in that remarkable condition in which it has now stood for
half a century, mainly because the great powers of the world have resolved
that for the peace of Christendom it is necessary that the Ottoman Empire
should stand. They came to that conclusion nearly half a century ago.
I do not think they have altered it now. The danger, if the Ottoman
Empire should fall, would not merely be the danger that would threaten
the territories of which that empire consists; it would be the danger that
the fire there lit should spread to other nations, and should involve all
that is most powerful and civilized in Europe in a dangerous and calamitous
contest. That was the danger that was present to the minds of our
fathers when they resolved to make the integrity and independence of
the Ottoman Empire a matter of European treaty, and that is a danger
which has not passed away."&mdash;<i>Mansion House speech, Nov. 9, 1895.</i></p></div>

<p>The veteran premier stated the fear of modern statesmen
that Turkey's fall would involve all civilization in a calamitous
conflict. The prophecy pictures just such a catastrophe,
in these words:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>"He shall come to his end, and none shall help him. And
at that time shall Michael stand up, the great Prince which
standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a
time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation
even to that same time."</p>

<p>What modern statesmen have seen impending and have
sought to ward off, the ancient prophecy says will surely come
to pass when the king of the north comes to his end,&mdash;a time
of trouble for the nations such as never was.</p>


<h4>In the New Testament</h4>

<p>In the prophecy of Revelation 16, the last great clash of
the nations is represented as following the fall of the power
that rules the territory drained by the Euphrates. Describing
the last events in human history, under the pouring out
of the vials of judgment upon the world, the prophet says:</p>

<p>"The sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river
Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way
of the kings of the east might be prepared." Rev. 16:12.</p>

<p>The water of the Euphrates represents the people or power
ruling by it. When anciently the Assyrians dwelt by that
river and were about to invade Israel, the prophet said, "The
Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong
and many, even the king of Assyria." Isa. 8:7. The waters
of the Euphrates meant the Assyrian power.</p>

<p>Just so in this prophecy, the river stands for the people.
As the Nile stood for Egypt, and the Tiber for Rome, so in
all modern times the Euphrates has stood for Turkey. The
"drying up" of the Euphrates must mean the ending of the
Turkish power. And in the verses immediately following,
Revelation pictures the gathering of the nations of the whole
world to Armageddon&mdash;"the battle of that great day of
God Almighty." Following Turkey's end comes the final
clash of nations. The earth quakes, the cities of the nations
fall, and the last judgments of God come upon a warring
world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, as in Daniel 12, is pictured a time of trouble for
the nations such as never was, and the end of the world,
when the power ruling in Syria, by the Euphrates, comes to
its end.</p>


<h4>The Approaching End</h4>

<p>For years statesmen and observers have discussed the approaching
dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Travelers
in Turkey have reported that thoughtful Turkish people
held the conviction that the crisis of their nation was near
at hand. Years ago Mr. Charles MacFarlane wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Turks themselves seem generally to be convinced that their
final hour is approaching. 'We are no longer Mussulmans,&mdash;the Mussulman
saber is broken,&mdash;the Osmanlis will be driven out of Europe by the
<i>gaiours</i>, and driven through Asia to the regions from which they first
sprang. It is Kismet! We cannot resist destiny!' I heard words to
this effect from many Turks, as well in Asia as in Europe."&mdash;<i>"Kismet;
or the Doom of Turkey" (London, 1853), p. 409.</i></p></div>

<p>A later Turkish traveler, Mr. Wilfred Scawen Blunt, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ancient prophecy and modern superstition alike point to the return
of the Crescent into Asia as an event at hand, and to the doom of the
Turks.... A well-known prediction to this effect, which has for ages
exercised its influence on the vulgar and even on the learned Mohammedan
mind,... places the scene of the last struggle in northern Syria,
at Homs, on the Orontes. Islam is then finally to retire from the north,
and the Turkish rule to cease. Such prophecies often work their own
fulfilment."&mdash;<i>"Future of Islam," p. 95.</i></p></div>

<p>Thus native tradition and human forebodings have contemplated
the break-up of the Turkish power, as the course
of the years has witnessed the shrinkage of its territory and
the ever-increasing difficulty of its position.</p>

<p>Now and then there has been a renewal of Turkey's vigor
and prestige; then again its situation has been rendered yet
more precarious. It has been a buffer between the clashing
interests of the great powers. Speaking of Turkey's difficult
position in this respect, the London <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, May,
1915, expressed a common view thus:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When once the nations of Europe set foot in Asia Minor, the pace of
Turkey's further downfall will be set not so much by Turkey's strength
or weakness as by the mutual jealousies of the occupying powers."</p></div>

<p>The storm clouds hang ever low over the Near East; while
above all the din of wars and rumors of wars, the voice of
divine prophecy declares that when this power comes to its
end, the closing events in human history will quickly follow.</p>

<span class="caption">CONSTANTINOPLE THE KEY CITY OF THE WORLD<br />

</div>

<p>The solemn truth rings in our ears like a trumpet peal;
the age-long Eastern Question is hastening on to its final solution,
and its solution brings the end of the world.</p>

<p>In the light of the "sure word of prophecy" the developments
of our day in the East become more than matters of
grave political concern to statesmen and observers of affairs
generally; they are matters of deepest personal, eternal interest
to every soul. In watching the trend of international
affairs, we are watching the doing of the last things among
the nations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>

<p>As these things are seen coming to pass exactly as the
prophecy foretold, we recognize them as God's call to men in
the last generation to turn to Him and prepare their hearts
to meet the coming Lord. Let no one think to wait until
he sees Turkey come to its end before making his peace with
God. The end of this power, as described in Revelation 16,
comes during the falling of the seven last plagues. And the
last verse of the preceding chapter shows that Christ's ministry
for sinners in the heavenly temple has ended before
the plagues begin to fall. Human probation will already have
closed. The solemn decree will then have been issued in
heaven:</p>

<p>"He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is
filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him
be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.
And, behold, I come quickly." Rev. 22:11, 12.</p>

<p>"Now is the accepted time," calls the Spirit; "now is the
day of salvation." 2 Cor. 6:2. We have not to make ourselves
ready. "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just
to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
1 John 1:9. Our part is to believe and confess;
His part is to forgive and cleanse and make us ready for
the coming kingdom.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The sure word of prophecy that foretold the rise and fall
of ancient empires, and outlined the general course of world
history through the ages, describes also the last great struggle
of the nations.</p>

<p>The proverb says, "Peace is the dream of the wise, but
war is the history of man." And divine prophecy assures us
that the history of this present world will end amid scenes
of conflict.</p>

<p>Many in our time have come to think that civilization must
reach a better way of composing the rivalries of the nations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
The prophecy forewarns us otherwise. In fact, the prophetic
word points to the talk of peace and safety amid
preparations for war, as a distinct sign of the latter days.</p>

<p>"In the last days," Isaiah says, "many people shall go
and say:"</p>

<p>"They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their
spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword
against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." Isa.
2:2-4.</p>

<p>This is what "many people" were to be saying. But the
real conditions in the last days are described as exactly
the opposite. The prophet Joel describes the real spirit of
the world in these times:</p>

<p>"Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles [the nations]: Prepare
war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war
draw near; let them come up: beat your plowshares into
swords, and your pruning hooks into spears: let the weak say,
I am strong." Joel 3:9, 10.</p>

<p>The context shows that the prophet is speaking of the
last times, when "the day of the Lord is near." Verse 14.</p>


<h4>The Prophecy Fulfilling</h4>

<p>This is what we have seen in our time, as never before
in the history of man,&mdash;the product of the plowshare and the
pruning hook being turned into instruments of war.</p>

<p>About twenty-five years ago the late Marquis of Salisbury,
speaking as a man grown gray in the service of the
state, asked a London audience the question, "What is the
great change that marks this time as different from the times
when most of us were young men?" The aged statesman
answered his own question, saying that it was the arming of
the nations, the swift race upon which the powers had then
recently entered, to increase their naval and military armaments.
It is a sign of our times, answering to the prophetic
forecast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>Throughout the present generation the thoughtful have
watched with grave forebodings the preparations of the nations
for war. Queen Alexandra, of Britain, once said of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I was educated in the school of a king who was, before all things,
just; and I have tried, like him, always to preach love and charity, I have
always mistrusted warlike preparations, of which nations seem never to
tire. Some day this accumulated material of soldiers and guns will
burst into flames in a frightful war that will throw humanity into mourning
on earth and grieve our universal Father in heaven."</p></div>

<p>As the race of armaments went forward on a scale never
before thought of, statesmen and writers began to make use
of the word "Armageddon" to describe the conflict that they
saw was inevitable. Years ago the London <i>Contemporary
Review</i> said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Odd things are happening everywhere.... Russia, Germany, England&mdash;these
are great names; they palpitate with great ideas; they have
vast destinies before them, and millions of armed men in their pay, all
awaiting Armageddon."</p></div>

<p>In June, 1909, Lord Rosebery, in a speech before a press
convention in London, commented gravely upon the significance
of the feverish haste with which the nations were arming
themselves, "as if for some great Armageddon, and that
in a time of the profoundest peace."</p>

<p>To quote from a popular American magazine, of the same
year:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Today all Europe is divided into two armed camps, waiting breathlessly
for the morrow with its Armageddon."&mdash;<i>Everybody's Magazine,
November, 1909.</i></p></div>

<p>Thus, everywhere, observers saw that the rivalry of interests
among the nations was leading to a conflict so
overwhelmingly vast that only the Scriptural word "Armageddon,"
with its appeal to the imagination, seemed adequately
suggestive of its proportions.</p>

<p>Every passing year added to the intensity of feeling and
the antagonism of interests. In 1911 the London <i>Nineteenth
Century and After</i> said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never was national and racial feeling stronger upon earth than it
is now. Never was preparation for war so tremendous and so sustained.
Never was striking power so swift and so terribly formidable.... The
shadow of conflict and of displacement greater than any which mankind
has known since Attila and his Huns were stayed at Ch&acirc;lons, is visibly
impending over the world. Almost can the ear of imagination hear the
gathering of the legions for the fiery trial of peoples, a sound vast as the
trumpet of the Lord of hosts."&mdash;<i>Quoted in the Literary Digest, May 6,
1911.</i></p>

<p>What the ancient prophecy foretold&mdash;the preparing of
war in the last days, the waking up and arming of the nations&mdash;we
have seen fulfilling before our eyes in this generation.</p>


<h4>Satanic Agencies at Work</h4>

<p>In prophecies of the gathering of the nations for the last
great struggle, Inspiration draws aside the veil, and allows
us to see the agencies that have been stirring up the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
for the war. As the prophet John was shown in vision the
scenes of the last days, he saw the invisible powers of Satan,
"the spirits of devils," going forth "unto the kings of the
earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle
of that great day of God Almighty." Rev. 16:14.</p>

<p>Earnest-minded statesmen have lamented their helplessness
to combat the forces and influences pressing the world
on toward conflict. In one of his last speeches as premier
of Great Britain, the late Marquis of Salisbury was defending
yet further calls for army and navy appropriations. He
said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"For years public opinion was in favor of a pacific policy, but now
that state of opinion has passed away. The tide has turned, and who
am I, and who are we, that we should attempt to stem the tide? If the
tide has turned, we shall have to go with it. We are in the presence of
forces far larger than we can wield."</p></div>

<p>What those forces were, the aged statesman did not recognize,
but the prophecy tells us. The prophet was shown
the evil spirits from Satan going forth everywhere as the end
nears, to stir up the whole world to the last great conflict.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Grey, British foreign secretary, described these
agencies very accurately. Speaking in the House of Commons,
Nov. 27, 1911, he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is really as if in the atmosphere of the world there were some
mischievous influence at work, which troubles and excites every part of it."</p></div>

<p>It is all coming to pass exactly as the sure word of prophecy
foretold.</p>

<p>The conviction that great and decisive events are at hand
has taken possession of many hearts in all the world. When
the European war broke out in 1914, on a scale unprecedented
in human history, it was no wonder that the question sprang
to many lips, "Is it Armageddon?"</p>

<p>The question was not lightly asked. The committee of
the Church Missionary Society (Church of England), one of
the greatest missionary organizations in the world, sent a
message to its missionaries in all lands at the outbreak of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
war. In this message was a call to prepare for the coming
of the Lord:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It may be that these events will quickly usher in the return of Christ
to gather His saints together from the four quarters of the earth....
Many see in the events preceding and accompanying this terrible cataclysm
of war the signs of our Lord's near return. If so, blessed will that
servant be whom his Lord when He cometh shall find giving 'their food
in due season' to those fellow servants who have been put in his
charge."&mdash;<i>Church Missionary Review, November, 1914.</i></p></div>

<p>Timely as this call was, it was evident, from the prophetic
scriptures, that the conflict then opening could not be the
Armageddon of the Apocalypse, for the prelude to that final
clash of nations is an event yet in the future&mdash;the downfall
of a nation whose part in the closing scenes is clearly described
in the prophecy of the coming Armageddon.</p>

<p>The end of the power which rules over the territory through
which the river Euphrates flows, is the prelude to Armageddon.
The prophecy says:</p>

<p>"The sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river
Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the
way of the kings of the East might be prepared." Rev. 16:12.</p>

<p>Next follows the gathering of "the whole world" to "the
battle of that great day of God Almighty." Verse 14.</p>

<p>Through all modern times Turkey has been identified
with the Euphrates. The region of Syria and Asia Minor,
long held by Turkey, has been the historic meeting place of
the East and the West. In the London <i>Fortnightly Review</i>,
May, 1915, Mr. J.B. Firth wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"When, with the fall of Ottoman sovereignty at Constantinople,
the Turk is driven out of Europe, there will arise once more the eternal
question of the possession of Asia Minor. That land is the corridor between
Europe and Asia, along which have passed most of the European
conquerors&mdash;the Russians alone excepted&mdash;who have invaded Asia,
and most of the Asiatic conquerors who have invaded Europe."</p></div>

<p>The fall of the Turkish power in this Euphrates region
will, in some manner, prepare the way for "the kings of the
East" to come up to the final conflict.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>


<h4>The Awakening of the East</h4>

<p>The same spirit that has been stirring up the West in preparation
for the contest has been working in the East also.
Year after year observers have pointed out the great changes
taking place in Asia. September, 1909, the London <i>Contemporary
Review</i> said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The whole of Asia is in the throes of rebirth. At last we may see
these three&mdash;the yellow race, the Indian race, and the Arab-Persian
Mohammedan race. And all that is making for the Armageddon."</p></div>

<p>A writer in the May, 1913, issue of the London <i>Nineteenth
Century and After</i>, reviewing the situation at the close of the
Balkan War, said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"A new spirit is abroad in the East. It arose on the shores of the
Pacific when Japan proved that the great powers of Europe are not invulnerable.
North and south and west it has spread, rousing China out
of centuries of slumber, stirring India into ominous questioning, reviving
memories of past glory in Persia, breeding discontent in Egypt, and luring
Turkey onto the rocks."</p></div>

<p>With all the nations stirred up by the spirit agencies of
the god of this world, the prophet next saw the armies of earth
gathering to the last great battle. The prophecy continues:</p>

<p>"And he gathered them together into a place called in
the Hebrew tongue Armageddon." Rev. 16:16.</p>

<p>Armageddon means the hill, or mount, of Megiddo, which
overlooks the plain of Esdraelon, the historic battle ground
of northern Palestine. Carmack says of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Megiddo was the military key of Syria; it commanded at once
the highway northward to Ph&#339;nicia and C&#339;le-Syria and the road across
Galilee to Damascus and the valley of the Euphrates. It was moreover
the chief town in a district of great fertility, the contested possession of
many races. The vale of Kishon and the region of Megiddo were inevitable
battle fields. Through all history they retained that qualification;
there many of the great contests of southwestern Asia have been decided.
In the history of Israel it was the scene of frequent battles. From such
association the district achieved a dark nobility; it was regarded as a pre-destined
place of blood and strife; the poet of the Apocalypse has clothed
it with awe as the ground of the final conflict between the powers of light
and darkness."&mdash;<i>"Pre-Biblical Syria and Palestine," p. 82.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus Armageddon, as the "military key of Syria," marks
Palestine and the Near East as the great international storm
center in the final conflict.</p>


<h4>The Political Storm Center</h4>

<p>In vision, nearly two thousand years ago, the prophet
saw the forces of the last days gathering around this pivotal
region. Today observers recognize the eastern Mediterranean
as indeed the pivotal point around which international
interests involving East and West naturally revolve.</p>

<p>Some years ago, in discussing railway development in Asia
and Africa, and the great highways of sea transportation,
the London <i>Fortnightly Review</i> said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Palestine is the great center, the meeting of the roads. Whoever
holds Palestine, commands the great lines of communication, not only
by land, but also by sea."</p></div>

<p>Again, the Manchester <i>Guardian</i>, emphasizing the importance
attaching to this strategic center, said during the great
war:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Egypt, as things are,&mdash;and the fact cannot be too often emphasized,&mdash;is
the weak spot in our system of imperial defense by sea power.
Not until Palestine is in our possession can Egypt be regarded as safe."&mdash;<i>Quoted
in Literary Digest, Feb. 12, 1916, p. 369.</i></p></div>

<p>Other nations have recognized the strategic value of a
territory so situated. Thus political considerations make this
region pointed out by the prophecy a center of conflicting
interests. Hogarth, in his book, "The Near East," calls it
"the time-honored storm center of the eastern Mediterranean."</p>


<h4>The Religious Storm Center</h4>

<p>To the conflict of political interests is added the rivalry
of religious sentiment. Commenting on the religious associations
of Palestine in relation to the international political
situation, the London <i>Spectator</i> some years ago stated the
matter thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"People often ask how it is that the future of Palestine presents such
difficulties. The reason is simply that Jerusalem&mdash;you cannot separate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
Jerusalem from Palestine&mdash;is the sacred city of so many creeds and warring
faiths. Not only is it the holy place of all the Christian churches,&mdash;and
two of them quarrel bitterly over it, the Greeks and the Latins,&mdash;but
it is also one of the most sacred places in the Mohammedan world.
Mecca and Medina are hardly more sacred than the Mosque of Omar.
That is a fact which is often ignored by Europeans, who forget that to
turn the Mohammedans out of the temple inclosure would disturb the
whole Moslem world, from the Straits Settlements to Albania. We must
never forget that Mohammedan pilgrims from India visit Jerusalem, just
as Christian pilgrims visit it from Europe. Lastly, Jerusalem is profoundly
sacred to the Jews, and the Jews are beginning to be locally
numerous and important. Most certainly there are no elements of difficulty
wanting in the problem of the future of Palestine."</p></div>

<p>History records the fact that rivalry over the care of the
traditional holy places helped to precipitate one European
war&mdash;that of the Crimea.</p>

<p>In the study of the Eastern Question, we have seen that
the prophecy of Daniel 11 marks Jerusalem as still a storm
center in the closing scenes. A British consul in Jerusalem,
in the days following the Crimean War, set forth suggestively
his view of one of the factors in the Eastern Question. He
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The very heart and kernel of the Eastern Question can only be
reached in the Holy City, Jerusalem, where the Eastern and Western
churches are still wrestling as of old for the mastery.... Now as heretofore,
disguise the object as they may, they are striving for a prize which
has not been destined by divine Providence for either; and this prize is
no less than a virtual dominion over the Christian world, from a throne
of government within the sanctuaries of the Holy City; and the possession
of that throne would involve possession of the key to universal
dominion."&mdash;<i>"Stirring
Times: Records from Jerusalem Consulate Chronicles," by
James Finn, introductory note by editor, p. xxiii.</i></p></div>


<h4>Foretold in Prophecy</h4>

<p>By every consideration&mdash;political, racial, and religious&mdash;the
Near East supplies all the elements for involving the
whole world when once the sweeping displacements begin
which the prophecy foretold, and for which statesmen in our
day have sought to prepare.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>Long ages ago the prophet of God, in vision on the Isle
of Patmos, was shown the clash of interests and the gathering
of the nations around this historic center. Before our eyes
today we see events tending to give to this region the very
character assigned to it by the prophecy. It was written in
the sure word of prophecy in order that, as the events foretold
are seen approaching, men may believe and turn to God,
and find salvation from the things coming upon the earth.</p>

<p>Into the prophecy of this sixteenth chapter of Revelation,
describing the gathering of forces to Armageddon, our Saviour
interjects the warning and the appeal:</p>

<p>"Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth,
and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see
his shame." Verse 15.</p>

<p>The last earthly events that the prophecy is dealing with&mdash;the
pouring out of the seven last plagues, and the clash of
Armageddon&mdash;come after probation closes. The close of probation,
the passing of the ministry of Christ in the heavenly
temple, will come as a thief, unannounced. Our only safety
is in yielding heart and life to him now for cleansing, and
accepting from his hand the garments of his own righteousness,
freely offered to every one.</p>


<h4>What Comes with Armageddon</h4>

<p>Whatever ambitions or aims may be the impelling motives
when the gathering to the great conflict comes, one
thing is certain: Armageddon is to bring triumph and world
dominion to no earthly power. As the nations gather, the
Lord intervenes from heaven, and the history of the kingdoms
of this world is closed at last. The prophet tells the sequel
to Armageddon:</p>

<p>"He gathered them together into a place called in the
Hebrew tongue Armageddon. And the seventh angel poured
out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out
of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.
And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were
upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. And
the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of
the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance
before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness
of His wrath. And every island fled away, and the
mountains were not found. And there fell upon men a great
hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent:
and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail;
for the plague thereof was exceeding great." Rev. 16:16-21.</p>

<p>The fall of the Turkish power is the prelude to the gathering
of the nations to the battle of Armageddon. And Armageddon
is the prelude to the end of the world and Christ's
glorious coming as King of kings and Lord of lords. The
armies gathered to battle for supremacy find themselves
suddenly arrayed against the armies of heaven. Another
prophecy describes the scene when Christ is revealed:</p>

<p>"The kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich
men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every
bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and
in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains
and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him that
sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for
the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to
stand?" Rev. 6:15-17.</p>

<p>Again, as the great searchlight of divine prophecy lights
up the way before us, we see by the course of present-day
events that the end is drawing very near. By what sudden
turn of affairs the last things to be done in history may be
set in motion, none can foresee. The Saviour admonishes
every soul, "Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour
as ye think not the Son of man cometh." Matt. 24:44.</p>

<p>It is for this time of waiting, especially, that Christ spoke
the parable of the ten virgins who waited for the bridegroom.
All sincerely wanted to meet him; all expected to be ready.
But when the cry was raised, "Behold, the bridegroom cometh;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
go ye out to meet him!" only five were ready. The
others lacked the oil that was to give them light. We know
what the oil represents&mdash;the genuine heart experience of the
grace and love of Christ.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 372px;">

<span class="caption">THE TEN VIRGINS<br />

&quot;They that were ready went in with him to the

</div>

<p>Those overtaken unready, hastened away to get oil. "And
while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and <i>they that
were ready</i> went in with him to the marriage: and the door
was shut." Matt. 25:10. Those that were ready went in;
those that were getting ready were too late. How came some
to be ready?&mdash;They were ready all the time; they kept ready.
This lesson is for us now. Our only safety is in being ready
every day, keeping sins forgiven, the life surrendered to God.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The millennium is the closing period of God's great week of time&mdash;a great
sabbath of rest to the earth and to the people
of God.</p>

<p>It follows the close of the gospel age, and precedes the setting up of the
everlasting kingdom of God on earth.</p>

<p>It comprehends what in the Scriptures is frequently spoken of as "the day of the
Lord."</p>

<p>It is bounded at each end by a resurrection.</p>

<p>Its beginning is marked by the pouring out of the seven last plagues, the second
coming of Christ, the resurrection of
the righteous dead, the binding of Satan, and the translation of the saints to
heaven; and its close, by the descent of the New
Jerusalem, with Christ and the saints, from heaven, the resurrection of the
wicked dead, the loosing of Satan, and the final
destruction of the wicked.</p>

<p>During the one thousand years the earth lies desolate; Satan and his angels are
confined here; and the saints, with Christ,
sit in judgment on the wicked, preparatory to their final punishment.</p>

<p>The wicked dead are then raised; Satan is loosed for a little season, and he and
the host of the wicked encompass the
camp of the saints and the holy city, when fire comes down from God out of
heaven and devours them. The earth is cleansed
by the same fire that destroys the wicked, and, renewed, becomes the eternal
abode of the saints.</p>

<p>The millennium is one of "the ages to come." Its close will mark the beginning
of the new earth state.</p></div>

<h2><a name="THE_MILLENNIUM" id="THE_MILLENNIUM"></a><b>THE MILLENNIUM</b></h2>


<p>The word "millennium" means "a thousand years."
This definite period is referred to specifically in but one chapter
of the Bible, the twentieth of Revelation; and in that
chapter it is spoken of repeatedly. We find it to be:</p>

<p>The period during which the saints reign with Christ in
judgment.</p>

<p>The period during which Satan is bound.</p>

<p>The measure of time between the two resurrections, that
of the just and that of the unjust.</p>

<p>An examination of the scriptures bearing upon the millennium
will show:</p>

<p>1. The events that mark its beginning.</p>

<p>2. The events that occur during the thousand years.</p>

<p>3. The events that come at the end of the period.</p>

<p>We shall find it clearly taught in these scriptures:</p>

<p>That the millennium begins at the second coming of Christ.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>That the reign of the saints with Him in judgment is not
on this earth, but in heaven.</p>

<p>That this earth, void of human inhabitants, is Satan's
prison house during the thousand years.</p>

<p>That at the end of the thousand years the judgment determined
is executed upon Satan and all the wicked.</p>

<p>That this earth, purified by the fires of the last judgment,
and renewed, becomes the eternal home of the saved.</p>


<h4>1. Events at the Beginning of the Thousand Years</h4>

<p>The key to the time is furnished by the declaration that
the millennium begins with&mdash;</p>


<h4>The Resurrection of the Just</h4>

<p>Speaking of the risen saints, the Scripture says:</p>

<p>"They lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
But the rest of the dead [the wicked] lived not again until
the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection."
Rev. 20:4-6.</p>

<p>There are to be two resurrections. The apostle Paul said
that this was the teaching of all Scripture: "There shall be
a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust."
Acts 24:15. The first resurrection, that of the just, marks
the beginning of the thousand years.</p>


<h4>Christ's Second Coming</h4>

<p>When is this first resurrection, in the order of events in
this "day of the Lord"? It is at the second advent of Christ.
One scripture, out of many, will suffice to state it:</p>

<p>"The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a
shout, with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump
of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first." 1 Thess. 4:16.</p>

<p>As the Saviour comes in glory, with all the holy angels,
the graves are opened, and His voice awakens His children
who sleep in the dust.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>"He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet,
and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds,
from one end of heaven to the other." Matt. 24:31.</p>

<p>The time of Christ's second coming, therefore, is the beginning
of the millennium.</p>


<h4>The Righteous Taken to Heaven</h4>

<p>The living righteous are translated, and, together with
the risen saints, are taken to heaven, as the apostle says:</p>

<p>"Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air:
and so shall we ever be with the Lord." 1 Thess. 4:17.</p>

<p>This was the Saviour's promise:</p>

<p>"In My Father's house are many mansions.... I go to
prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place
for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself;
that where I am, there ye may be also." John 14:2, 3.</p>


<h4>The Destruction of the Wicked</h4>

<p>At Christ's second coming the wicked are slain. The unbelieving
left without shelter in that day, cannot endure the
presence of such glory as will burst upon the world:</p>

<p>"The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His
mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that
know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ." 2 Thess. 1:7, 8.</p>


<h4>The Binding of Satan</h4>

<p>With the saints in heaven, beyond the reach of Satan's
wiles, and with the wicked dead, not to live again till the
thousand years are finished, Satan is "bound"&mdash;confined by
divine power to this earth, which becomes his prison house,
there being neither saint nor sinner upon whom to ply his arts
of deception. No prisoner was ever more effectually chained.
The symbolical language of the prophet pictures the scene:</p>

<p>"I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key
of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the
Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast
him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal
upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till
the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must
be loosed a little season." Rev. 20:1-3.</p>

<p>These are the events that mark the beginning of the thousand
years: Christ's second coming, the resurrection of the
just, the ascent of all the redeemed to the city of God, the
death of the wicked, and, in consequence, the binding of Satan.</p>


<h4>2. Events During the Thousand Years</h4>


<h4>In Heaven</h4>

<p>Scene after scene of glory is spread before us in the visions
the prophets were given of the redeemed in the city of God.
The prophet John says:</p>

<p>"After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which
no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people,
and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb,
clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands....
Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve Him
day and night in His temple." Rev. 7:9-15.</p>

<p>They "serve" in the temple of the Lord, the prophet says;
while the poet sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whence came the armies of the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John saw in vision bright?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence came their crowns, their robes, their palms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too pure for mortal sight?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From desert waste, and cities full,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From dungeons dark, they've come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now they claim their mansion fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They've found their long-sought home."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One service in which the saved have part during the thousand
years is the work of judgment that still remains, preparatory
to the final visitation of sin and the destruction of
Satan and all his works. The prophet saw this work going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
forward in the heavenly courts, the redeemed associated with
Christ in the service:</p>

<p>"I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment
was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were
beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God,
and which had not worshiped the beast, neither his image,
neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in
their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand
years." Rev. 20:4.</p>

<p>It was to this work of judging the wicked and the evil
angels, that the apostle Paul referred in the counsel to the
Corinthians: "Do ye not know that the saints shall judge
the world?... Know ye not that we shall judge angels?"
1 Cor. 6:2, 3.</p>


<h4>On Earth</h4>

<p>While in heaven above the saved are with Christ and the
holy angels before the throne, and follow the Lamb whithersoever
He goeth, it is to be remembered that on earth all is
desolation and emptiness. The wicked have been slain by
the glory of Christ's coming. By the quaking of the earth
the cities of the nations have fallen in ruin, islands have been
removed, and mountains cast into the depths of the sea. The
condition of the earth during this time of desolation is thus
described by the prophet:</p>

<p>"I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and
void; and the heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the
mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved
lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the
birds of the heavens were fled. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful
place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken
down at the presence of the Lord, and by His fierce anger."
Jer. 4:23-26.</p>

<p>"Without form, and void," said the prophet. This is the
same phrase that is used in the opening verses of Genesis to
describe the chaotic state of the earth in the beginning. At
the beginning of creation week the earth was in a state of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
emptiness and chaos&mdash;an "abyss," as it is called in the
Greek translation of Genesis. Again, during this thousand-year
period, the earth is an "abyss," or a desolate waste.
"Abyss" is the meaning of the word translated "bottomless
pit" in the text telling of the binding of Satan by the mighty
angel of God:</p>

<p>"He laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is
the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and
cast him into the bottomless pit." Rev. 20:2, 3. The Revised
Version says, "And cast him into the abyss."</p>

<p>Confined to this pit or abyss of desolation, as a prisoner
in a prison house, with none to tempt, the author of sin has
a thousand years in which to view the ruin that sin has wrought
in the earth that once left its Maker's hand beautiful and
perfect, unmarred by any curse.</p>


<h4>3. Events at the End of the Thousand Years</h4>

<p>At the end of the millennium, this earth becomes the
scene of events that close the great controversy between
Christ and Satan.</p>


<h4>The Descent of the Holy City</h4>

<p>The judgment work in heaven having been accomplished,
the hour has come for the execution of the judgment upon
sin and sinners. The holy city comes down out of heaven.
The prophet saw its descent in vision:</p>

<p>"I John saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down
from God out of heaven." Rev. 21:2.</p>


<h4>The Loosing of Satan</h4>

<p>"When the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be
loosed out of his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations."
Rev. 20:7, 8.</p>

<p>With all the wicked destroyed by the glory of Christ's
second coming, Satan had been effectually bound; but now,
as the city descends, the voice of Christ calls forth the wicked
dead, and Satan is thus loosed, and assumes control again of
those who have chosen him as their master.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the time of which the Scripture speaks: "The rest of
the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished."
Verse 5. The prophet saw the hosts of the lost called forth.
"The sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and
hell [the "grave," margin] delivered up the dead which were
in them." Verse 13.</p>

<p>Thus Satan's subjects come forth to the last judgment.
The resurrection of the wicked of all the ages is the loosing
of Satan. Here again is his kingdom, and again he plies his
deceptions and takes up anew his fight against God. How
very natural that Satan should persuade the wicked that he
has raised them to life, that his word in the beginning was
true, "Ye shall not surely die"! If they are immortal, why
may they not yet prevail against God? Satan rallies his
angels and the hosts of the wicked, in numbers "as the sand
of the sea," to make an attack upon the city of God.</p>

</div></div>

<p>"They went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed
the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city." Verse 9.</p>

<h4>The Wicked Before the Bar of God</h4>

<p>But as the hosts of evil compass the city, they are halted
by the glory and majesty of the Redeemer's presence, enthroned
as eternal victor over sin. Just here must apply
the prophet's words:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw a great white throne, and Him that sat on it, from
whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there
was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small
and great, stand before God; and the books were opened:
and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and
the dead were judged out of those things which were written
in the books, according to their works." Rev. 20:11, 12.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 445px;">
<img src="images/p358.jpg" width="445" height="298" alt="THE HOLY CITY DESCENDS

<span class="caption">THE HOLY CITY DESCENDS<br />

&quot;Behold, the tabernacle of God is with
men.&quot; Rev 21:3.</span>
</div>

<p>During the thousand years the records in heaven have
been reviewed, and the degrees of guilt established. Now the
judgment is to be pronounced and executed. But first the
record of the books and the eternal righteousness of God's
holy law are flashed by divine power upon the consciences
of all the lost&mdash;"their conscience also bearing witness" (Rom.
2:15) that they are without excuse.</p>

<h4>The Destruction of Sin</h4>

<p>Sin is now to be blotted from the universe of God; and
those who have chosen to be identified with sin perish with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
it. All that Infinite Love can do has been done in the gift
of Christ to save men from the transgression of the holy law
of God. That salvation rejected, there is nothing remaining
that heaven can offer. There is no further sacrifice that can
be made. "There remaineth no more sacrifice for sins."
Heb. 10:26.</p>

<p>Then follows the last scene in the conflict with evil:</p>

<p>"They went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed
the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city:
and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured
them. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the
lake of fire.... And death and hell [the grave] were cast into
the lake of fire. This is the second death." Rev. 20:9-14.</p>

<p>The second death ends sin and the author of sin, and
death itself. The controversy is ended. Christ's death has
purged sin from the universe of God.</p>


<h4>The Earth Purified and Made New</h4>

<p>The fires that consume the wicked melt the earth and
purify it from all trace of the curse. It is the day of which
Peter wrote:</p>

<p>"Wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and
the elements shall melt with fervent heat." But after this
cleansing of every element of this sin-cursed earth, the promise
of God will be fulfilled in the earth made new, as the eternal
home of the saved. As Peter says, after telling of the day
of burning, "Nevertheless we, according to His promise,
look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."
2 Peter 3:12, 13.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_HOME_OF_THE_SAVED" id="THE_HOME_OF_THE_SAVED"></a>THE HOME OF THE SAVED</h2>


<h4>The Land of Peace</h4>

<p>The Bible opens with a new heaven and a new earth,
perfect from the Creator's hand; with man sinless and having
access to the tree of life in the midst of the Eden paradise,
out of which flowed a river that spread its life-giving waters
through the earth.</p>

<p>The Bible closes with a new heaven and a new earth;
with man upright and sinless, having right to the tree of
life growing in the midst of Eden; with the river of life flowing
out from the garden of God, clear as crystal.</p>

<p>Between the two scenes spreads out the panorama of six
thousand years of conflict with sin. It is a story of the fall
of man, of the loss of his Eden home, of the curse that marred
the earth, of sin and sorrow and death overspreading all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>


<h4>The Restorer</h4>

<p>But from the hour when the shadow of sin fell upon the
earth, there has been a light shining in the darkness. Amid
the ruin that sin had wrought, there appeared the great Restorer.</p>

<p>The inspired record gives a word-picture of Jesus taking
man's place to win back the lost dominion:</p>

<p>"Unto the angels hath He not put in subjection the world
to come, whereof we speak. But one in a certain place testified,
saying, What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?
or the son of man, that Thou visitest him? Thou madest
him a little lower than the angels; Thou crownedst him with
glory and honor, and didst set him over the works of Thy
hands: Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet.
For in that He put all in subjection under Him, He left nothing
that is not put under Him. But now we see not yet all
things put under him. But we see Jesus." Heb. 2:5-9.</p>

<p>Just where Adam fell and lost his dominion over the earth,
we see Jesus, the second Adam, taking man's place and winning
back the lost inheritance. That is why the picture of
the new earth and man's sinless state depicted in the first
two chapters of the Bible is repeated in the last two chapters
with even greater fulness of glory. God's original plan and
purpose will be carried out, and this earth, renewed, will be
the eternal home of sinless men and women, redeemed by
grace.</p>

<p>Sin will be found not to have frustrated, but only to have
delayed, the purpose of God. And what is six thousand
years in working out the divine plan? In our brief span we
may divide human history into ancient, medieval, and modern;
but in heaven's life a thousand years are but as "a watch
in the night;" and these six watches are to heaven but as one
night of grief and of loving ministry in rescuing the lost.</p>

<p>It has cost all that heaven had to give. But the infinite
Gift was made, and all heaven has wrought at the work. Of
the angels it is written, "Are they not all ministering spirits,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?"
Heb. 1:14.</p>


<h4>Bringing Back the Lost Dominion</h4>

<p>Of all the worlds that shine in the heavens, declaring the
glory of God, this earth is the one that was lost. Its light
went out in darkness. It wandered from the fold of God's
perfect creation.</p>

<p>Then the divine Shepherd came to find it and bring it
back. And the angels that rejoiced when they saw this earth
created,&mdash;"when the morning stars sang together, and all
the sons of God shouted for joy,"&mdash;will again rejoice as the
Lord brings back His own,&mdash;this earth, redeemed from
the curse, shining in the bright universe again with the perfection
of the glory of God.</p>

<p>Christ not only redeems lost men, but He is to redeem
this lost earth. "The Son of man," He said, "is come to seek
and to save that which was lost." Luke 19:10.</p>

<p>By sinning, man lost not only his righteousness and his
life, but his dominion as well. Originally man had dominion
"over all the earth." Gen. 1:26. As the psalmist says,
"Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy
hands." Ps. 8:6. He was prince and ruler of the earth.
But when he yielded to Satan's temptation, he yielded up that
dominion to the enemy, thus placing himself in the power
of his foe. Satan thus became the "prince of this world,"
exercising the dominion wrested from man.</p>

<p>But through Christ, this dominion is to be restored. The
prophet of old said:</p>

<p>"Thou, O tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter
of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion;
the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem."
Micah 4:8.</p>


<h4>The Hope of the Promise</h4>

<p>The promise of the gospel of salvation is the promise not
only of life eternal through faith, but of an eternal inheritance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
in the earth made new, the fulfilment of the Creator's
plan when He made this world to be the home of man. This
was the star of hope that shone before Adam and Eve as they
stepped forth from Eden into a dying world. It was the
promise to Abraham, "the promise, that he should be the
heir of the world." Rom. 4:13.</p>

<p>It was not the promise of the world in its present state.
For the Lord gave Abraham "none inheritance in it, no, not
so much as to set his foot on." Acts 7:5. Abraham himself
did not look for the promise to be fulfilled in this sinful
earth, but in the earth made new, redeemed from sin. The
Scripture says of his hope:</p>

<p>"By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a
strange country: ... for he looked for a city which hath
foundations, whose builder and maker is God." Heb. 11:9, 10.</p>

<p>It was in the new earth and the New Jerusalem that Abraham,
the father of the faithful, expected to receive the eternal
inheritance promised to him and to his seed. And there all
the faithful will find their inheritance.</p>

<p>"If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs
according to the promise." Gal. 3:29.</p>

<p>The psalmist said, "The meek shall inherit the earth."
Ps. 37:11. Christ repeated it: "Blessed are the meek: for
they shall inherit the earth." Matt. 5:5.</p>

<h4>The New Earth and the New Jerusalem</h4>

<p>Through the prophet Isaiah the Lord described the re-creation
of this earth to be the home of the saved:</p>

<p>"Behold, I create a new heavens and a new earth: and
the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
But be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create:
for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a
joy. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in My people:
and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her,
nor the voice of crying." Isa. 65:17-19.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not of old Jerusalem that the prophet is speaking,
but of the New Jerusalem, which John saw coming down,
with the saints, from God out of heaven. He saw it descending
upon the earth at the end of the thousand years, and saw
the wicked come forth from their graves to judgment. Then
he saw the fires of the last day falling upon the lost, consuming
sin and sinners, and purifying the earth itself from every
trace of the curse. It is the day of which Peter wrote, "Wherein
the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements
shall melt with fervent heat." But he adds, "Nevertheless
we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a
new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." 2 Peter 3:12, 13.</p>

<p>Out from the dissolved elements of the earth and the atmospheric
heavens the Creator's power again calls forth new
heavens and a new earth, the old creation cleansed and renewed
in the perfection of the original Eden paradise. It
is coming; for John saw it in vision. "I saw," he says, "a
new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the
first earth were passed away." Rev. 21:1.</p>

<p>He saw the city which had come down from heaven&mdash;those
mansions that Christ is now gone to prepare&mdash;the
New Jerusalem, the holy capital of the eternal kingdom of
the saints, where Christ's own throne is set.</p>

<p>"I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them,
and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with
them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears
from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither
sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for
the former things are passed away. And He that sat upon
the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He
said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful."
Rev. 21:3-5.</p>

<p>It passes comprehension; but it is true. And the life of
the saved in their eternal inheritance will be just as real as
is life upon this present earth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p>"They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they

wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat
straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's meat.
They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain,
saith the Lord." Isa. 65:21, 25.</p>

<p>The whole earth will be as the Eden paradise planted by
God in the beginning. And from week to week and from
month to month the saved will gather to worship before the
glorious throne in the holy city.</p>

<p>"As the new heavens and the new earth, which I will
make, shall remain before Me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed
and your name remain. And it shall come to pass, that from
one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another,
shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the Lord."
Isa. 66:22, 23.</p>


<h4>The Glories of the Saints' Eternal Home</h4>

<p>As the first two chapters of the Bible tell of earth's original
perfection, so the last two chapters constitute one psalm of
ecstasy over the indescribable glories of the earth made new,
with its city of light, the walls of jasper, the gates of pearl,
the river of life flowing from the throne of the Lamb, clear as
crystal, with the widespreading tree of life on either side of
the river. And supreme above all, Jesus Himself, "the King
in His beauty," without whom there would be no glory even
in that city foursquare; "for the glory of God did lighten it,
and the Lamb is the light thereof."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Next to the loveliness and grace of Christ our Saviour,
the glories of this world to come have inspired the sweetest
hymns of hope for longing hearts. How often has the spirit
been lifted above earth's trials as we have sung,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O that home of the soul! in my visions and dreams<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With songs on our lips and with harps in our hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet one another again!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which
God hath prepared for them that love Him."</p>

<p>Through the ages, the children of the promise have been
journeying toward the city which hath foundations, whose
builder and maker is God, and they have confessed themselves
pilgrims and strangers in this present world. As they
have followed the way of righteousness,&mdash;oftentimes a thorny
path,&mdash;it has been with the shining city ever before their
vision. As they have fallen in death, it has been with closing
eyes fixed upon "that day" when Christ shall come to take
His people to the New Jerusalem preparing above</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Lamb there in His beauty<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Now earth's course is nearly run. It is but a little way to
the holy city, where the water of life flows clear as crystal
from the midst of the throne. The water of life is really there;
for the Lord showed it to the prophet John in vision, that
he might tell us that he saw it. "I John saw the holy city,"
he says, "and he showed me a pure river of water of life,
clear as crystal." Rev. 21:2; 22:1.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p>Christ invites every one to share the eternal inheritance,
giving assurance of His power to save to the uttermost all
that come unto God by Him. He is knocking at the door of
every heart, asking admittance, in order that He may take

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
